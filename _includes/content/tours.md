Welcome to the Harlan Tours Page.  Over the years, the Harlans have taken three tours that included England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales in search of the sites of our roots.  We visited such highlights as St. Peter's Church in Monkwearmouth (site of the baptism of George), Sutton Hall outside of York with its nearby church, the Lurgan Meeting in Northern Ireland and the Harland Moors in Yorkshire.

### "Kiss Me, I'm Irish" Hollingsworth Tour - October 17-25, 2005:

Since the Hollingsworth and Harlan families have many connections, the Hollingsworth's would like any Harlan's to join them. For further information, please contact Susan Aggarwal at [VNSAGG@aol.com](mailto:VNSAGG@aol.com).

Welcome to an opportunity for treading in the footsteps of our ancestors. See our history
as it unfolds in the homeland of our family – in a very special way! Join the members of the
Hollingsworth Family as we examine the roots of our family as they lived and worshiped in England and Ireland over three hundred years ago. Perhaps better understand what drove them to embark on a perilous journey that changed the family legacy for centuries into the
future. Time spent together in these locations can also change our lives. Bring your grandchildren and children to search for their family beginnings.

The tour will be accompanied by Marjory Harlan Sgroi, a Harlan family member who has arranged four previous tours to examine that family’s history -- which so mirrors our own.
Come along on a truly unforgettable trip!

Friday, October 21  
After breakfast, today will be devoted to searching out ancestral connections. Mr. Valentine
Hollingsworth was born in Ballyvickcrannel in County Armagh in 1632. His family was originally English but migrated to Ireland as “adventurers.” He became a Quaker while still in
Ireland but later immigrated to Delaware (then Pennsylvania) in 1687, along with the Harlands, another Quaker family. The two families inter-married in America. The first meeting of the Quakers (Religious Society of Friends) was held in Lurgan in 1654, followed by the Lurgan Meeting House, built in 1696. Since the visits of the Harlans in 1994 and 1995, there is a new Meeting House, replacing one badly in need of repair. We will have a meeting with members of the congregation and hear about the history of the parish, followed by lunch prepared by members of the congregation. The rest of today will be spent learning about the history of the Hollingsworths in Northern Ireland. We have some new information about local connections to explore because of a recent trip by John Hollingsworth. Dinner and
overnight will be at our Armagh hotel this evening. (B, L, D)

Saturday, October 22  
Following breakfast, we drive south to Dublin via Newry, Dundalk and Drogheda. We will stop at the Hill of Tara, known as the seat of the High Kings of Ireland. Then we will continue on to Dublin, arriving early afternoon, in time for an independent lunch in the city. This afternoon we will visit St. Patrick’s Cathedral, founded in 1190. The original structure has been rebuilt many times, with a 300-foot long interior (the longest in Ireland) containing many historic relics. Jonathan Swift (author of Gulliver’s Travels) was once Dean here. We will have a stop at the Marsh Library, adjacent to the Cathedral. It was built in 1701 by Archbishop Marsh and was the first public library in Ireland. It contains ancient manuscripts that are chained in small cell-like cubicles, originally for their protection. After this busy day, we check into our hotel with this evening free for dining in Dublin. (B)
