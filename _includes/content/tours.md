Welcome to the Harlan Tours Page.  Over the years, the Harlans have taken three tours that included England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales in search of the sites of our roots.  We visited such highlights as St. Peter's Church in Monkwearmouth (site of the baptism of George), Sutton Hall outside of York with its nearby church, the Lurgan Meeting in Northern Ireland and the Harland Moors in Yorkshire.
