Preface by Alpheus H. Harlan:

"This book had its beginning in the Fall of 1881. I made a visit in September of that year to several of my father's cousins in order to learn from them something of the life and history of my great-grandfather Harlan. I knew little of my ancestors at that time, but found there several old letters and records which contained much that I had wanted to know. It became my desire, then, to trace my own line back to an immigrant ancestor, and, later, to set down in permanent form all that could be learned concerning the family. That desire of so long ago has culminated in the present volume.

"No one, unless he has attempted a similar task, can have an adequate conception of the work thus involved. There were seventeen children born to George and Micheal Harlan. Of Deborah, the third daughter of George, we know little more than that she married one Joshua Calvert; further trace of the family has been lost. Solomon, the fifth son of Micheal, died unmarried. So it remained to follow the subsequent history of fifteen families, and though some of the lines are incomplete, most or them will be found to be well developed.

"In 1887, two hundred years after George and Micheal had come to America, the family assembled at Birmingham Park, near Philadelphia. There they effected a permanent organization which was named " The Association of the Descendants of George and Micheal Harlan in the United States." It has held fourteen reunions, some of the most important of which have been at Richmond, Ind., 1888; West Chester, Pa., 1897; Mt. Pleasant, Iowa , 1899; Union City, Ind., 1900; and again in Richmond in 1912. It has been the means whereby members of the family have learned to know and to keep in touch with each other, and it has been of great assistance in the preparation of the present work.

"The information herein contained has been gathered from many sources. Old wills, marriage certificates, Friends' Meeting records, newspapers, and hundreds of letters have been read and reread in order to obtain from them some information which would be of use. Often one name has been the means of bringing together many families, and often one letter has opened a field requiring months of work to fully explore.

"The compiling of this history has been to me from the first a labor of love and of fascination and a work that I could not lay aside. I have been aided in it by countless relatives and friends, and to all of them, though many have long since passed away, my heartfelt gratitude must be expressed. 

"After a third of a century of almost continuous endeavor, I am handing this work to my people for their approval. I do it with the earnest prayer that the present and future generations shall strive hard to uphold the standards as set and maintained by their forefathers."

**James HARLAND #1** was born about 1625 in Bishoprick, Durham, England. He died in England. He was buried in England. From "History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family" by Alpheus Harlan- "James Harland, Yeoman and member of the Episcopal Church, was b. about the year 1625 in the "Bishoprick, Nigh Durham, England," and is the earliest paternal ancestor known to the family in America bearing the name Harlan. He lived and d. an Englishman, and was bur. upon English soil, no one to-day knows where. Tradition says that the name of his father was William.

"That James Harland was married according to the usages of the Established Church there is no doubt. That his children were baptized and recorded therein is fully established by the fact that the earliest record we have of his son, George, is that he was "Baptised at the Monastery Monkwearmouth* in Oald England." We have no record giving the name of the wife and mother. So far as is known, James Harland was the father of three sons:

"*Monkwearmouth Monastery was founded by Benedict Biscop in the year A.D.672. It is situated in a town of the same name in the east division of Chester, County Durham, and one-half mile north of Sunderland. It receives its name from its location near the mouth of the river Wear. Burned and plundered time and again, only the tower and some detached parts of the church remain of the once celebrated monastery. In 1790 the parish registers, with the exception of some of the late records, were destroyed by fire, and it is probable that information of untold value perished in the flames." 

James HARLAND #1 had the following children:

2 i. Thomas HARLAND  
3 ii. George HARLAN  
4 iii. Michael HARLAN

**SECOND GENERATION**

**2. Thomas HARLAND** was born about 1648 in Bishoprick, Durham, England. He was buried in Lurgan Parish, Armagh, Ireland. From "History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family" by Alpheus Harlan- "Thomas Harland, Yeoman, Friend, b. "Nigh Durham, in Bishoprick, England, where he remained until early manhood, when with his brothers and others he crossed over into Ireland and located in the Parish of Donnahlong, County Down. It is supposed that he remained there during life, and that he was buried in the burying grounds at Lurgan Meeting House, County Armagh. He m. 2, 7, 1680, by ceremony of Friends at Lurgan Meeting, held then "at the house of Francis Robson," in the Parish of Sego, County Armagh, Katherine Bullock (Friend), b.----, d. 3 mo.1690, County Down, a daughter of George Bullock, of the Parish of Donnahlong. They were parents of one son Ananias, and of four daughters, Rebecca, Patience, Christian, and Katherine.

"Thomas m. second, 11, 8, 1702 Ailice ffoster, of "Lisnegarvy, at Richard Boyes house, Ballinderry Meeting, County of Armagh. They were the parents of two sons, James and Thomas, and one daughter, Abigail.

"We find the names of George Harland, Alphonsus Kirk, etc., among the signers to Thomas Harland's first marriage certificate, but it seems that this brother did not venture to cast his lot in the new world. So far as we can learn he remained in Ireland; we find his descendants, some fifty years later, crossing into Pennsylvania, and settling in Chester County. The further line of Thomas Harland, obtained too late to be inserted here, will be found given in the appendix." 

He was married to Katherine BULLOCK on 7 Apr 1680 in Parish Sego, Armagh, Ireland. Thomas HARLAND #2 and Katherine BULLOCK had the following children:

1.  Ananias HARLAND 
1.  Rebecca HARLAND 
1.  Patience HARLAND 
1.  Christian HARLAND 
1.  Katherine HARLAND 

He was married to Alice FOSTER on 8 Jan 1702/3 in Ballinderry Meet, Armagh, Ireland. Alice FOSTER was born. Thomas HARLAND #2 and Alice FOSTER had the following children:

1. James HARLAND  
1. Thomas HARLAND
1. Abigail HARLAND 

**3. George HARLAN** was born in 1650. He was christened on 11 Mar 1650 in Monkwearmouth, Durham, England. He died in Jul 1714 in Kennet, Chester, Pennsylvania. He was buried in Jul 1714 in Center Meeting Burying Grounds, Chester County, Pennsylvania. From "History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family" by Alpheus Harlan- "George Harlan, Yeoman, "Ye sone of James Harland of Monkwearmouth, was Baptised at the Monastery of Monkwearmouth in Oald England, ye 11th Day of First Month 1650." He was b. "Nigh Durham in Bishoprick, England," and remained there until he reached manhood, when, in company with his brother and others, he crossed into Ireland and located in the County Down. While residing there he m. by ceremony of Friends, 9, 17, 1678, Elizabeth Duck. George Harlan* brought his family to America in 1687, and the nine years intervening were without doubt spent in the above named-parish and county, and there, too, in all probability, his first four children were born. He d. in "Fifth Month" (July), 1714, and was buried beside his "deare wife in the new burying grounds on Alphonsus Kirk's land,"which was afterwards, and is yet, Center Meeting Burying Grounds. George and Elizabeth were parents of nine children:

"*After coming to America George and Michael Harland dropped the final "d" and the name is almost universally spelled Harlan."

Alphaeus Harlan citing the Marriage Book of Lurgan Mo.Mtg., p.91: "George Harland, of Parish of Donahlong, Co. Down, Ireland, and Elizabeth Duck, of Lurgan, Parish of Shankill, Co.Armagh, were married "at the house of Marke Wright in ye Parish of Shankill," 9 Mo. 17, 1678. 

Signers to the certificate: Henry Hollingsworth, Wm.Porter, George Harland, John Calvert, Timothy Kirk, Elizabeth Harland, Roger Kirk, Alphonsus Kirk, Robert Hoope, Elinor Hoope, Deborah Kirk, Thomas Harland 

Alphaeus Harlan citing Wm Stockdale's "A Great Cry of Oppression."- "George Harland had taken from him for Tithe, by Daniel Mac Connell...twelve stooks and a half of Oats, three stooks and a half of Barley, and five loads of Hey, all worth ten shillings ten pence."

"No certificate of the membership of George Harland with Friends is upon record, but his marriage certificate shows us that at that time he was a member, and as early as "Tenth Month" (December), of 1687, was placed upon committees of responsibility in Friends' affairs in his new neighborhood. At the time of his residence in Ireland, William Penn was urging Friends of England to become settlers upon his lands, cautioning them, however, against "leaving their own country out of idle curiosity or of a rambling disposition." But names signed above we find later in the new world, and, as we have seen, George was buried upon "Alphonsus Kirk's land." So they were not without friends when they made their settlement near the Delaware.

"In the early months of the year 1687, in company with his wife and four children, and his brother Michael, then unmarried, he took hip at Belfast for America. They had bought lands before coming * which were within that part of the Province of Pennsylvania now embraced in the County of New Castle. Ascending the river Delaware they landed at the town of New Castle (now in Delaware State), and seettled near the present town of Centreville. Here the elder brother remained for some years, and about 1698/99, having purchased higher up the Brandywine Creek, he moved his family and settled in what is now ** Pennsbury Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. 

*"From the old warrants granted "within the County of New Castle, on Delaware,: we learn that "George Harland" and "James & Thomas Harlin" purchased lands there in the summer of 1686, and that "James Harland" did likewise in January of 1701.

**"It was then in Kennett, but later the township was subdivided."

**4. Michael HARLAN was born about 1660 in Bishoprick, Durham, England. He died in Jun 1729 in London Grove, Chester Co., Pennsylvania.

"Nigh Durham, in Bishoprick, England, about the year 1660," and in early life em. with his brothers into Ireland and settled with them in the County of Down. Here he remained until 1687, when he accompanied his brother George to America. "And ye beginning of ye yeare 1690," Michael Harlan m.
