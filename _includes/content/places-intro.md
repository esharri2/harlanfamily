"Names Upon the Land" is a database of places which carry the Harlan name. It consists of place names (mainly geographic and political, but also buildings) in the 50 United States. Steve Harrison is maintaining the data and we would like to invite all to submit additions, corrections, or additional information to the sites.

You may provide information to Steve by e-mail [2johnmuir@gmail.com](mailto:2johnmuir@gmail.com) or by regular mail to:  
Steve Harrison  
869 Indian Hill Road  
Hendersonville, NC 28791  

We want to include history that links a place name to an individual.
