Several printed sources of Harlan genealogy are in existence today. They are: History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family, by Alpheus H. Harlan (No. 4816). It was originally printed, Baltimore, 1914, and reprinted in 1987, 1988 for the Harlan family by Gateway Press, Inc., to commemorate the Tricentennial of the Harlan Family in America 1687-1987. Library of Congress Catalog Card Number 87-81324. The History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family consist particularly of the descendants of George and Michael Harlan, who settled in Chester County, Pa., 1687. 

An Updated Genealogy: The Descendants of #194, Aaron and Elizabeth (Stuart) Harlan, compiled by Joydelle Garrett Wolfram (No. 4275) copyright 1990 by Joydelle Garrett Wolfram for Harlan Reunion of Blue Ridge, Falls County, Texas. Published by Design, Type and Graphics, Dallas, Texas. Library of Congress Catalog Number 92-070898. This print, (commonly known as the "Texas Red Books"), consists of the descendants of #194, Aaron and Elizabeth (Stuart) Harlan; appendix I, Samuel Harlan, #195; and appendix II, Valentine Harlan, #200. 

For further information about these books, and how they may be purchased, see store area here in The Harlan Family Web Site. Additional information may also be found in the Genealogy and History Pages in the site.

## Capturing New Data

Since the 310 Harlan Family Reunion held in Mt. Pleasant Ia., and the creation of the Harlan Web Site, there seems to be a growing interest in capturing newly updated Harlan genealogy data.

This project would strive to capture genealogy data for future generations, and provide a contact link for those working on their lines for sharing information. Since there are two printed Harlan genealogy sources it will be necessary to make every effort to tie the new data into these sources, to avoid duplication of data and confusion. 

Data may fall into one of three categories:

1. Direct reference to History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family, by Alpheus H. Harlan.
1. Genealogy data submitted which has not been tied to History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family.
1. Updates, corrections, to previously printed data.

Persons who wish to submit their updated genealogy lines may do so by one of the following methods:

- paper copies
- files created by genealogy software packages that can be read by Family Tree Maker
- files sent via the internet

Data may be sent to:

- **Fred Harlan**, at [fredharlan@verizon.net](mailto:fredharlan@verizon.net) or to

- **Cynthia Rhoades**, 98 Northwood Drive, Hagerstown, IN 47346, [cr.rhoades@comcast.net](cr.rhoades@comcast.net)

If you would like further information before submitting data please contact one of the above. In order for us to reference back to the History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family, we are proposing a numbering system as follows: 

- Harrison #5862 - as listed in the book.
- Fred #5862-9 - being ninth child of Harrison
- Harold #5862-94 - being fourth child of Fred
- Junior #5862-942 - being second child of Harold
- If tenth child, number would be #5862-a; eleventh child would be #5862-b and so on.

If you already have your line numbered, we would renumber your data. If not, if you would number your data as suggested it would help this effort tremendously. 

At the time of submission of data we would like your permission to place your name as contributor and a method of contact for other individuals on the Harlan site. 

The data captured will be only as good as the records provided by the submitter. The association will not make an attempt to authenticate the data, but merely to capture it for future reference.
