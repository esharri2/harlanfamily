A "Best of Britain" tour is planned for May 25 – June 3 2025!

This trip is a great chance to see Scotland and England and explore a
little bit of Harlan family heritage. The tour will visit St. Peter’s Church in
Monkwearmouth where our Harland family worshipped and were baptized
prior to becoming Quakers.

**The deadline for reserving your spot is October 30.**
