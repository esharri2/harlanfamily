In 2001, the city of Marshall, Ill. purchased an opera house built in the mid-1800s and named it Harlan Hall for its builder, Howard Harlan #5737. It has recently been added to the National Register of Historic Places.

Howard was the oldest child of a family of eight born to Justin Harlan (#2255) and wife, Lucinda. He was born in Clark County, Ill. on September 19, 1832. After his schooling he became a lumberman before beginning a livery business in 1859 and later, he owned a hotel named Sherman House. In addition to being a businessman and builder, he served as Postmaster at Marshall during Lincoln's presidency. (Reference: History of Crawford and Clark Counties, Ill., edited by William Perrin and published in 1883.)

The City of Marshall is in the process of restoring the building and making it a community center. Downstairs--once a brick livery stable built by Howard in 1871--will be a senior center. The opera house upstairs will have a full working theater and there are plans to locate a small museum, which will feature the building, on an original balcony.

Another possibility for Harlan Hall is the location of an interpretive center concerning the heritage of the National Road, sponsored by the National Road Association.

Anyone wanting to tour Harlan Hall and see the progress of its restoration is invited to contact Elizabeth Richey, secretary of Marshall, at 217-826-8087, M-F.
