Some Harlin family members are restoring an ancestral home in Gainesville, with Chris Harlin heading up the project. Chris has established an interesting Web site about the project: [http://www.oldharlinhouse.com](http://www.oldharlinhouse.com)

The family lineage is: George #3, Aaron #8, Samuel #40, George #189, Samuel #688, James #2319, John William Harlin, John C. Harlin (who built the house), Hugh Tan Harlin, John L. Harlin and Chris Harlin.

John William Harlin moved from Monroe County, Kentucky, to Gainesville in 1869. According to Alpheus Harlan's genealogy book, some of Samuel's (#688) children and grandchildren spelled their surnames as "Harlin" and "Harling," though Samuel's listing in the book is "Harlan."

Visit the Old Harlin House Web site to view the progress of the ambitious restoration.
