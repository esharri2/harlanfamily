title: Harlan House-Stargazer Farm 
---

The Harlan House-Stargazer Farm is on the National Register of Historic Places. Michael Harlan (#3) purchased the property in 1688 from William Penn's 1681 land grant from King Charles II. He gave the property to his eldest son, George (#14). George's descendants lived in the stone house until 1950. The family tradition is that the house was started in the 1690's, but the exact dates of its construction are unknown.

It is currently the home of Dr Kate Roby, veterinarian and Harlan history friend, who has been researching and restoring the house for 40 years.

It is called Stargazer Farm, because it was the headquarters of Mason and Dixon's commission (1764-68) to survey and mark the PA-MD boundary.  The Mason Dixon Line and associated marker stones are a National Historic Engineering Landmark.
