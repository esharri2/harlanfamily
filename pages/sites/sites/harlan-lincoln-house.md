Mount Pleasant, a city of 8,500, is in the southeastern corner of Iowa, a region of rolling hills and farm fields, twenty-eight miles west of Burlington and the Mississippi River. James Harlan built the extant house onto the front of an earlier residence when he returned to Mount Pleasant after his service in Washington, D.C. The house is situated on the north edge of the Iowa Wesleyan University campus, a reminder of James Harlan's presence at the college and community. Harlan served as president of Iowa Wesleyan, as professor, and as trustee.

Harlan's daughter, Mary, married Abraham Lincoln's son, Robert Todd Lincoln, in 1868 in Washington, D.C. During the 1870s and 1880s, Mary Harlan Lincoln brought their three children, Mary, Abraham Lincoln II "Jack", and Jessie, to spend summers with the Harlan grandparents. She said Mount Pleasant was "restful and good for the children growing up." At the time, Robert was an attorney in Chicago and took the train to Mount Pleasant to spend time with his family.

Senator Harlan deeded the property to the Robert Todd Lincolns in 1895, and Mary made improvements to the house, including a wraparound front porch. She hosted two catered parties in the fall of 1895, welcoming people from the college and community to her home. By 1907, with her parents no longer living and the family having built a home in Manchester, VT, Mary Harlan Lincoln gave the house to Iowa Wesleyan University as a tribute to the memory of her father.

Since 1959, the college has maintained the Harlan-Lincoln House as a museum. The museum includes artifacts belonging to the Harlan and Lincoln families: a fragment of the coat Abraham Lincoln was wearing when he was assassinated; Mary Todd Lincoln's mourning veil; Harlan's desk, globe, and recliner; a door measuring the heights of the grandchildren in 1883; grandson Jack's rock collection and tennis net; family silver, dishes, books, furniture, and clothing. The Harlan-Lincoln House tells visitors the story of the James Harlan family from when James and Ann Harlan built their home through when their great-grandchildren visited there.

The Harlan-Lincoln House is open to the public Monday to Friday, 12:00 pm to 4:00 pm. For more information or to schedule a tour, contact Anna Villareal, Director of the Harlan-Lincoln House at (319) 385-6319 or [hlhouse@iw.edu](mailto:hlhouse@iw.edu). The mission of the Harlan-Lincoln House and its collection is to interpret the site to the public for its significance to the Harlan and Lincoln families, to reinforce the relationship to Iowa Wesleyan University, and to fulfill the home's vital role in the living history of the University and the Mount Pleasant community.
