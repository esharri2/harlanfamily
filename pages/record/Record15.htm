<td>Editors and publishers of The Harlan Record for twelve&nbsp; years,

Tom and Marylee Harlan of Shelton, WA, retired after the spring edition

of the newsletter. They were active in Harlan Family activities prior to

the 1987 Celebration 300.

<p>While living in Virginia, they made several trips to New Castle to meet

with other family members in planning the Delaware family reunion and were

responsible for the first reprinting of Alpheus Harlan�s genealogy book

as well as the program for the 1987 reunion. As a result of that gathering,

Tom was selected to serve as President of the Family for the next 10 years.

In addition to publishing The Harlan Record until 1999, Tom and Marylee

went on two Harlan family tours to England and were the registrars at Celebration

310 in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. The couple has been involved with the Harlan

Family web site and will continue this service.</td>

</tr>

</table></center>

Both Tom and Marylee are native Northwesterners from the state of Washington�Tom

is from Vancouver and Marylee is from Spokane. Tom had a 30-year-career

as Public Affairs Officer for the U.S. Forest Service and held positions

on the Siuslaw National Forest in Corvallis, OR; and in regional offices

in Portland, San Francisco and Missoula. He ended his career in the National

Office&nbsp; in Washington, D.C. Marylee�s career was a personnel specialist

for various federal agencies in the same locations where Tom worked.

<p>After retiring in 1989, they settled on Harstine Island, WA, in lower

Puget Sound where they live surrounded by acres of clams. They live in

a waterfront development and have a view of Mt. Rainier, Case Inlet, lots

of wildlife including deer, raccoons, birds, foxes and squirrels. They

have both been active in community affairs and currently, Marylee is president

of the homeowners� association which includes 530 properties and facilities

including a marina, club house, tennis courts, swimming pool, 3 miles of

beach and picnic facilities, private roads and water treatment.

<p>Tom�s major activity in retirement has been learning to play the bagpipes

which includes weekly practices, a lot of parades, weddings, funerals and

other events. His Scottish heritage has become equally important as his

English/Irish Harlan roots. He has his own kilt and can claim connections

to Wallace and Henderson clans.

<p>The couple enjoys their three grandsons who are able to spend time with

their grandparents in the summer, and they enjoy their motor home and sailboat

activities.

<p>The Harlan Family regretfully�but with gratitude�accepts the resignation

of Tom and Marylee Harlan as editors and publishers of The Harlan Record

and thanks them for twelve years of service to the Harlan Family!

. . .</font></i></b></center>



<p>Greetings, Harlan cousins,

<p>It�s a privilege to be your current President. But I�m still not quite

sure how it happened. I was sort of standing around, not paying much attention

and what do you know, the Board said, �You�re it.�

<p>My feet aren�t particularly dainty, for sure. But I�m having anxiety

attacks concerning my ability to fill the shoes of my two predecessors.

Dan, of course, was the father of our reborn Family Association. There

simply would not have been a Harlan Family organization again if he had

not been inspired to create the idea back in the early 1980s and push through

Celebration 300 in 1987.

<p>Tom then became our president for the better part of a decade. He and

Marylee, as editors of our Record, were extraordinarily important in maintaining

the growing vitality of what I�m sure is now one of America�s leading family

heritage societies.

<p>We�re really fortunate, we Harlans. When I tell others about The Harlan

Family in America, our great national reunions, our regional get-togethers,

our web site and so on, their reaction is almost always, �I sure wish our

family had something like that.�

<p>The Harlan �statement of purpose� on this page has been put together

by our Board. I wonder how many families have set out such a philosophy

as we have. That really says it all, doesn�t it? And although I know the

shoes I�ve inherited are much too roomy, I sure will do my best to help

our Board carry out our Family objectives.

<p>Fraternally, Robert R. Harlan

<div align=right><a href="#up"><img src="../images/up.gif" border=0 height=35 width=35 align=RIGHT></a>

<hr size=3 width="100%"></div>



<center><a name="mission"></a><b><font size=+1>THE MISSION of THE HARLAN

FAMILY IN AMERICA, 1998</font></b></center>



<p>Our family heritage organization exists for two comprehensive reasons.

One is philosophical. The other is operational.

<p><b>I. PHILOSOPHY</b>

<p>Throughout human history, the single most powerful force for our welfare,

protection and happiness has been, simply, the Family.

<p>The influence of the human family has been unfortunately illustrated

by the cascading social and human behavior problems of our 20th Century.

Sadly, these problems are directly proportional to the massive increase

in the number of dysfunctional American families.

<p>Therefore an important purpose of the Harlan Family in America is to

project and communicate, by our example, the importance and benefits of

the human family to the human experience. Our goal is to define the character,

values, heritage and traditions of the generations of families in America

bearing the names of Harlan, Harland, Harlin and Harlen.

<p>We will accomplish this by continuing to develop the bonds of our own

extended Harlan Family throughout America and wherever Harlans may be living

in other countries. In so doing, we will demonstrate the pride, the sense

of belonging, and the security that flows from being, simply, a member

of the family that cares about its own.

<br>&nbsp;

<p><b>II. SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONAL OBJECTIVES</b>

<p>As our family heritage organization continues to mature, our specific

�operational� objectives will of course be subject to change. At this time

in our development, the following are the essential areas on which we will

focus:

<p>� Continue to identify new Harlan Family members, descendants of George,

Michael and Thomas, and those Harlans whose surnames have changed with

marriage. Our task is to let them know of our Harlan Family Organization

that is available to them, and to encourage them to join;

<p>� Continue to build strength and interest among our members by frequently

communicating information about the Family, its current activities and

plans, its history and heritage with all available means: local, national

and regional reunions; newsletters and other direct mail; web site, etc.,

and encourage communication among individual family members;

<p>�&nbsp; Continue to develop genealogical resources and knowledge to

identify our history and heritage both in America and in Britain, and to

discover and preserve�via historians and genealogists� history, documents,

memorabilia and records;

<p>� Identify and preserve Harlan historical sites which have influenced

our Family, in our country and abroad, such as the Harlan�Lincoln Home,

the Delaware Landing Site, the Brandywine Area, and Harlan sites in England

and Ireland, and promote family gatherings and travel to these sites;

<p>� Maintain a strong and efficient organization with an adequate and

sound financial base and a repository for Family information, and have

regular meetings and communication among Board Members and all other Harlans

involved;

<p>�&nbsp; Create and foster all other activities that will enable members

of the Harlan Family to be good, responsible and productive citizens of

this land.

<a name="brief"></a>After a protest by 250 citizens against&nbsp; the selling

of Whitehall Farm�once owned by Aaron Harlan (#2256)�to developers, the

following story was submitted by the author. Later it was reported that

the developers were not successful in their bid to purchase.

<center>

<p><b><font size=+1>A Brief Moment in History by Cynthia Ressler</font></b>

<br><b>descended from George #180 and Sarah #674</b>



</center><p>At the end of a narrow dirt lane, once lined with majestic walnut trees,

stands a grand old lady who is an historic moment. The cool, dank soil

cradling her foundation also cradled the footsteps of Indian moccasins.

The soil surrounding her foundation was land of the disputed Louisiana

Territory, claimed by the monarchs of Europe at one time or another. Today

this grand dame remains serene in the midst of 940 acres, half the size

of her former self.

<p>The town of Yellow Springs (OH) sprang up when people seeking cures

for poor health went there to bathe in the area mineral waters. In 1808,

a patriarch of Cincinnati obtained a large parcel of land by land grant

just north of Yellow Springs and sent his ailing son there to recuperate

from dissipations. There the son fell in love with and married his nurse,

a Yellow Springs girl. At the time of his death, the son willed the land

to his wife. The will was contested by his family in Cincinnati, and the

case was fought in court for nine years by a Quaker lawyer named Aaron

Harlan (#2256).

<p>Aaron, a native of Warren County, Ohio, was born in 1802, the year before

Ohio became a state. Friend Harlan was practicing law in the small town

of Xenia just down the road from Yellow Springs. His first wife had died,

and he married Amanda Sroufe Baum, the widow of the young man from Cincinnati,

in 1840. Taking his three motherless children, Aaron moved to Yellow Springs

to make his home with the new Mrs. Harlan on her land. Five children were

born to their marriage while living on Whitehall Farm.

<p>Two years later Aaron, now 40, began construction of the white pillared,

brick house that he designed. It contained twelve

<br>20 x 20 ft. rooms, and his efforts were majestic. So grand were his

plans that he had to sell a large portion of the original 1,800-acre farm

for working capital to build the house. Over the years barns, stables,

kennels, tenant houses and a bath house were clustered around Whitehall.

<p>Inside, one wall in the drawing room contains two fireplaces of white

marble. Flemish tapestry covers another wall. A gracefully curved walnut

staircase spirals to the second floor. Aaron installed stained glass windows

on the upper curve of the staircase. The walls were two feet thick and

were constructed of brick kilned on the Whitehall land. A gray marble fireplace

dominates one end of the dining room, opposite a door to the east side

formal garden. In a small sitting room at the west side of the house, book

shelves extend from floor to ceiling on one wall. The wood used in the

building came from groves on the farm.

<p>Cattle raising was at one time the principal interest of the farm. Jersey

cattle and white-faced Herefords roamed the fields. Baptan Pearl, the sire

from which 80% of the shorthorn herd bulls in the United States today trace

their pedigree, grazed on the land of Whitehall, making the farm renowned

in stock circles.

<p>The great house took a leading part in political happenings of the territory,

which were indeed political happenings of the entire nation. Legend says

that Whitehall is the scene of the birth of the present Republican party.

Friend Aaron Harlan was a believer that Thomas Jefferson influenced the

writing and passage of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 which abolished

slavery from the territories lying north of the Ohio River. As a Quaker,

he considered himself a representative of the principles of the Northwest

Ordinance.

<p>Aaron was a member of the House of Representatives of Ohio in the Thirty-first

and the Forty-fourth General Assemblies, and he was a member of the House

of Representatives in Congress from 1852 to 1859. Selling the farm in 1864,

he and his family moved to California where he died four years later, and

his wife Amanda followed him in death just a brief month later.

<p>Whitehall is a farm that stands tall in the glory of its past.

BROTHERS</font></b>



</center><p>Within a six-month period of time, the Harlan Family of America lost

two talented brothers�<b>Robert H. Harlan</b> of Freeport, IL, who died

November 26, 1998, and his younger brother, <b>Charles H. Harlan</b> of

Plymouth, MN, who died May 8, 1999, after a long illness. Their Harlan

ancestors are George, James, John, John, Aaron, Jacob, Elzephus and Robert.

<p>Robert (b. 12-27-17)&nbsp; and his wife, Lois, attended Celebrations

300 and 310 and had �the experience of that special never-to-be-forgotten

trip to England and Northern Ireland in 1994, visiting places where Harlan

ancestors had once walked. Best of all was the Harlan companionship they

found at these gatherings,� Lois wrote.

<p>Bob served 30 years in the U.S. Foreign Service at diplomatic and consulate

posts abroad and in the State Department at home. During his 19 years of

retirement he served 12 of them on the board of the local college and was

active in many community endeavors through raising money and planning projects.

In 1992 he received a Public Service Citation from the University of Chicago

Alumni Association, and in his last years he spent hours each week volunteering

in the public schools, listening to second graders read. Bob received his

bachelor�s and doctor of jurisprudence degrees from the University of Chicago.

<p>Charles (b. 9-22-22) received bachelor�s and master�s degrees from Western

Reserve and for a time, he pursued a career in biological research. He

later changed to business and worked for Minneapolis Honeywell until his

retirement in 1986. He was an organist and composer.

<p>The two brothers left children, grandchildren and�in the case of Bob�great-grandchildren

to carry on the Harlan tradition.

<br><b><font size=+1>FORMED FIRST UTILITY COMPANIES IN NORTHWEST</font></b>



</center><p>Kenneth George Harlan, son of Elwood Harlan #8506, was born in 1891

in Leadville, Colorado. He became an electrical engineer and formed a consulting

business called Carey &amp; Harlan which focused on the mining trade. His

wife was Ruth Ledgerwood, a graduate of Cheney Normal College (near Spokane)

who was teaching in Kettle Falls, Washington, when they met. Kenneth�s

job took the couple to towns in Washington and Idaho where their sons,

Kenneth George, Jr. and Robert Lee were born.

<p>Kenneth was incredibly busy originating electrical systems in many rural

cities at the time electricity was coming into wide use. He formed public

utility districts including one in Portland. In 1927 Kenneth was appointed

by President Hoover&nbsp; to organize what later became the Bonneville

Power Administration. He and Ruth were invited to attend a Hoover White

House reception and later they dined with Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt

in Hyde Park in the early 1930s. FDR appointed Kenneth as consulting engineer

for the Grand Coulee Dam among other duties of appraising private power

companies and giving testimony to the legislature on hydroelectric power

rate analyses, about which he was an expert.

<p>Kenneth once ran on the Republican ticket for Senator from Oregon but

was defeated. He later became very involved in Democratic politics but

eventually became disillusioned. He died of cancer in his forties.

<p>Sons Kenneth, Jr. and Robert attended Hill Military School and Beale

Military School and graduated from both Lakeside School in Seattle and

the University of Washington. Kenneth, Jr. became an electrical engineer

for Lockheed in Los Angeles, and Robert became an attorney, later starting

his own lumber company, Pacific Wood Products which became Harlan Pacific.

<p>Kenneth, Jr. died in the late 1970s, but Robert is still working and

frequently travels. Recently he has been to Spain, Portugal and Morocco.

He has homes in Rancho Mirage, Bellevue, WA, and a vacation place on Puget

Sound. Robert and one of his six children, Kirk, attended the 1987 Harlan

Reunion in Delaware, and he takes great pride in his Harlan ancestry.

<center><a name="search"></a><b><font size=+1>GENEALOGY SEARCH HAS SURPRISE</font></b></center>



<p>Last year Phillip Reynolds, husband of Sara Jo Reynolds, heard from

an unknown third cousin, Jeffrey Palmer. While viewing his family�s web

site, Sara Jo realized that her husband�s cousin and she were related on

his mother�s line and that they were half-7th cousins, three times removed

on their Hollingsworth side (some of whom married Harlans). It seems that

Jeff

<br>descends from Valentine Hollingsworth, Sr. and first wife, Ann Ree.

Sara Jo descends from Valentine and his second wife, Ann Calvert.

<p>Sara Jo, whose mother was a Harlan, is continually discovering new relatives

through genealogy searches. She makes good use of the vertical files found

in most libraries. These files contain family news articles, stories, charts,

pension papers, and whatever people submit. She recommends leaving family

information in areas where the family lived. In vertical files she often

<br>stores her ancestor chart, generation chart and a page of her family

with her name and address. She has been contacted and has discovered new

relatives as well as interesting stories of ancestors.

<p><br><a name="contribution"></a><b><font size=+1>IT�S CONTRIBUTION TIME

AGAIN</font></b>



</center><p>Unlike most other organizations, it is a proud tradition of our Harlan

Family Association that no dues are required to be a member. All descendants

of George, Michael and Thomas are urged to join. There is no barrier to

membership for Harlans who might find dues a burden.

<p>This means the costs of maintaining our Association must be met largely

by contributions from interested Harlans (plus modest profits from sales

of our Family History Green Volumes).

<p>Naturally, despite careful financial management, there are inescapable

costs�printing and mailing our �newspaper�, The Harlan Record, and reprinting

the Harlan history books.

<p>One such demand is the next great Harlan Family national reunion, tentatively

planned for 2002. As we found with the 1997 Reunion, up-front costs are

substantial. Although committee members paid their own expenses to attend

the several meetings (travel, rooms, meals), there were large advance extra

expenses including printing and mailing, advance deposits, etc.

<p>Now we�re beginning the 2002 preparations (yes, it does take that long!!).

Our Association needs your contributions to build our sound financial base.

So please give some serious thought to your next donations to the Association.

Send in the form with as generous a contribution as you can. Those of us

who do so feel we�ve been repaid many times over for supporting a

<br>truly fine purpose�building and maintaining one of America�s leading

family heritage societies. Thanks.
