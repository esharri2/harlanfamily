            />Poised, passionate, patriotic — words which aptly described Judith
            Harlan Chaffin as she took the stage at Constitution Hall during the
            119th Continental Congress of the National Society, Daughters of the
            American Revolution in Washington, D.C., this past summer. Judith
            was completing her 3-year term as the State Regent of Tennessee, and
            she presented a glowing report of the projects and activities that
            her state society had completed during her term of office.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to the Congress, Judith had also been nominated by the
            Tennessee Daughters to stand for election as a Vice President
            General, one of the highest offices in the NSDAR. Seven members are
            elected each year by the Continental Congress for a term of three
            years. Not surprisingly, Judith was handed a decisive victory.
            Accepting the office is an honor and responsibility that she does
            not take lightly, as she is passionate about her service to God,
            Home and Country.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judy, as she is known to her family and friends, has been on an
            amazing journey that began with her birth in Jonesboro, Ark., on
            August 3, 1947. Undoubtedly, her father's return from World War II,
            where he fought on Bataan and Corregidor, was captured by the
            Japanese, and spent more than three years as a prisoner of war, left
            an indelible impression on Judy and her younger sister Marilyn.
            Grateful to have survived the war, her father and her
            schoolteacher-turned-homemaker mother instilled in their daughters a
            sense of responsibility, a feeling of compassion, and a love of
            learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judy grew up on the family farm in the shadow of her Grandfather
            &quot;Papa&quot; Harlan's general store, attended a country school,
            and had a typical childhood filled with 4-H Club, sports, piano
            lessons and pets. She worked in the cotton fields from a young age,
            learning to save and manage her money well. In high school she
            excelled as a student and was editor of the high school yearbook.
            While attending Arkansas State University, Judy met her future
            husband, James A. Chaffin. After they married, Jim served a 7-year
            stint in the U.S. Air Force, and Judy completed her studies in
            English and Library Science, graduating from Washburn University in
            Topeka, Kan. Moving frequently and living in different places during
            their years with the military gave Judy a love of travel, an
            interest in history, and a passion for new experiences. According to
            her friend, Susan Thomas, &quot;Judith cares deeply about her family
            and her friends, and is a multi-talented, bright and interesting
            woman with a quick and curious mind.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Jim and Judy eventually settled in Memphis where Jim became a pilot
            for Federal Express and Judy took on the duties of raising their two
            boys, Brett and Blake. She taught school, served as a children's
            librarian, and became involved in a variety of other activities,
            including genealogy and family history. Judy taught Bible study
            classes for 25 years, and the Chaffins are now active members of
            Covenant Baptist Church, a church they helped found in 1997. She has
            published a 903-page book with a DVD preserving images and
            information from over a thousand pre-Depression Era Bibles.
          </p>
          <p>
            An invitation to join the DAR started her on her present path. Her
            accomplishments in the chapter, state and national organizations are
            numerous and impressive, with an emphasis on education and America's
            veterans and military. She is especially committed to such DAR
            projects as the rehabilitation of the war-wounded, providing
            supplies to female soldiers overseas, establishing scholarships for
            American History teachers, and funding educational programs in
            schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judy says, &quot;I am very proud of my Harlan lineage,&quot; adding
            that she is also a member of the National Society, Daughters of
            Founders and Patriots of America. To qualify for this small but
            mighty group, a member must descend directly from someone who was in
            the country by 1687 and have a direct patriot in that line who
            served the revolutionary cause. She qualified through George (#3)
            and his grandson, Aaron (#41). The two Chaffin grandchildren, Olivia
            and Abigail, are members of the Children of the American Revolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to Susan, Judith Harlan Chaffin, being the hard worker and
            inspirational leader that she is, is ready for the new challenge,
            that of serving her term as Vice President General, National
            Society, Daughters of the American Revolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judy's recorded Harlan family lineage is: George (#3), Aaron (#8),
            Aaron (#41), Valentine (#200), Valentine (#746-a), Don Sebastian
            (#2570-g), Mortimer, Leonidas, and her father, Henry Crawford
            Harlan.

              Thomas Daniel Harlan stands beside the cooling tower and cistern
              outside of his cotton gin sometime during the 1930s. Water was
              used to cool the diesel engine that powered the gin's machinery.
              The gin crew took baths in the cistern because the water was warm
              and fairly clean.

          <p>
            Thomas Daniel Harlan (called &quot;Dan&quot; or &quot;Daniel&quot;)
            was a 10th generation descendant of Capt. William Harland,
            grandfather of George (#3) &amp; Michael (#4) Harlan, the two
            brothers who came to America in 1687. Dan was also an admirable,
            influential citizen of Falls County, Texas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using Alpheus Harlan's numbering system, Dan's Harlan lineage is:
            William Harland (#1), George Harlan (#3), Aaron (#8), Aaron (#41),
            Aaron (#194), James (#708), Thomas Daniel Harlan (#2380), John
            Luther Harlan (#6095), Thomas Daniel Harlan [Dan is listed among his
            father's children, p. 543 of Alpheus Harlan's History and Genealogy
            of the Harlan Family, but is not given his own number; he is #2022
            in Joydell Garrett Wolfram's Updated Genealogy: The Descendants of
            #194 Aaron and Elizabeth (Stuart) Harlan, commonly called
            &quot;Texas Red Books,&quot; see p. 467-71].
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan was a farmer, stockman and cotton ginner in the Blue Ridge
            community of Falls Co., Texas. Born October 29, 1894, he died July
            5, 1939, probably of pneumonia, and is buried in the Calvary
            Cemetery, Marlin, Falls Co., Texas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan was the first child of John Luther Harlan and Elizabeth Strawdy
            McGlasson. John was a cotton ginner and passed the business down to
            his son.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan attended schools in Blue Ridge and Reagan, Texas, and then he
            entered The Peacock Military College in San Antonio. On April 28,
            1914, Wesley Peacock, of the Peacock Military College, wrote the
            following to Dan's parents:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &quot;… Now that our school session is drawing to a close, I feel
              constrained to express to you my appreciation of your son, both
              from the viewpoint of a student and a personal friend, for I
              consider him one of the finest boys in Texas, a dutiful son,
              diligent pupil and already a good citizen. I use the term ‘dutiful
              son' advisedly, in the belief that he has been a good boy at home,
              profiting by the advice of his father and mother, as he has always
              shown the strongest attachment for the home folks and the highest
              appreciation of the home influence. I do not know a higher
              compliment I can pay a boy than the foregoing sentiment, unless it
              be that in my opinion he is a perfect gentleman. I wish you to
              know that he enjoys not only the favor and friendship of every
              teacher and officer of this school, but he enjoys also the
              confidence and respect of every student in the institution.
              Withal, he is one of the most popular men among our boys and I am
              sure that when you see him again you will be pleased not only with
              his physical and moral development, but with his improvement in
              the amenities of life and the many little courtesies in evidence
              of appreciation of the sacrifices you and his dear mother have
              made for his temporal welfare. I should like very much to have Tom
              Daniel return to us in September …&quot;
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            It is no exaggeration to state that he maintained this reputation
            throughout his lifetime. Some remember him as being a strong
            possible candidate for elected office in Texas or Washington, D.C.,
            but he died before he could attain a place in Texas political
            history.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1917, when the United States entered WWI, Dan enlisted in the
            Army and served as a corporal until the end of the war, earning an
            Honorable Discharge.
          </p>
          <p>
            On January 15, 1922, Dan married Josephine Blocker Torrence
            (1895-1978), daughter of Clifton Hurley Torrence and Julia Agnes
            Blocker. Dan and Josephine lived in an upstairs apartment at his
            parents' home in the Blue Ridge community until 1923, when their
            home was constructed in Marlin. (The John &amp; Elizabeth Harlan
            home still stands, bought and restored/updated by another Harlan
            descendant.) Dan and Josephine had two daughters, Julia Elizabeth,
            born in 1923, and Agnes Versula, born in 1924.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan's activities were not limited to farming and ginning in the Blue
            Ridge community but extended into Robertson County where he owned
            another gin. He had many interests and diversified his ventures. He
            was active in community, state and federal affairs; served on the
            Marlin school board for many years; was a director and president of
            the Marlin Country Club, and was a member of Masonic Lodge #152. His
            primary relaxations were hunting and skeet shooting, and he
            established a skeet range for that sport.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1932, Dan went with a group of Texans to Washington, D.C., in
            support of a &quot;Relief Bill&quot; for cotton farmers, passed in
            1933. He assisted many men to establish their own businesses and
            quietly helped young students to attain higher educations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reared as a Baptist, in his later years his friendship with
            Episcopal Bishop Frederick Percy Goddard led him to an interest in
            St. John's Episcopal Church in Marlin, and he supported that
            church's activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herschel Powers (father of this article's author) was married to
            Harlan descendant Arrilla Cobb [&quot;Texas Red Book&quot; #2538]
            and worked for Dan Harlan (his wife's distant cousin) as foreman at
            the Blue Ridge gin. During the fall harvest and ginning season, the
            gin crew closed down at noon every Saturday so workers and their
            families could go to town for weekly shopping, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another Harlan descendant, George Dewey Owen (&quot;Dewey&quot;), a
            great-grandson of Isaiah Harlan, was a local cotton farmer. He was
            notorious for bringing his last weekly load of cotton for ginning
            almost at noon every Saturday.
          </p>
          <p>
            One fall Saturday, the gin crew members had finished ahead of
            schedule and were taking a quick bath in the gin's cistern when they
            heard Dewey's team of mules pulling his wagon toward the gin. They
            immediately locked up and hid out in the cottonseed house. Dewey
            called for them without receiving a reply. He then drove his wagon
            home, instead of leaving it under the gin's shed. It started raining
            that weekend and Dewey's cotton sprouted in his unprotected wagon,
            ruining the cotton lint and seed. Dan Harlan found out about this
            from Dewey and did not like the fact that the gin crew had not
            ginned Dewey's cotton. He bawled out gin foreman Herschel Powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, Dan was loyal to his foreman. He helped Arrilla and Herschel
            during the Depression era. When the Depression hit, the couple
            worried about how they would make ends meet, put food on the table
            for their five children, and simply stay healthy. Dan told them not
            to worry. &quot;Let's stick together and we'll come out of this all
            right,&quot; he said. And so they did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan gave Herschel a wonderful barbeque sauce recipe that is still
            used by the Powers family. When Dan died, Herschel Powers lost one
            of his best friends ever. He remembered Thomas Daniel Harlan often
            and had learned many lessons from him.

          <h2><a name="hallows"></a>90th Harlan-Miller Indiana Reunion</h2>
          <h4>By Esther Harlan Wells &amp; C.J. King</h4>
          <p>
            In the Fall 2009 issue of The Harlan Record, a story was published
            about the Harlan-Miller Reunion in Crawfordsville, Ind., and how it
            became the setting for a reunion between Nina Harlan Kohl and
            cousins she had never met, all descendants of George Newton Harlan
            and Carrie Belle Snyder.
          </p>
          <p>
            That Harlan-Miller reunion has been meeting almost every year since
            1921, and on the second Sunday of June, 2011, the gathering will
            celebrate its 90th anniversary. The reunion is held in the North
            Shelter at Milligan Park in Crawfordsville, and the gathering will
            be extra special in June 2011. In addition to the usual potluck
            feast and conversation, there will be a skit and special prizes,
            including a quilt made with squares that the family members have
            signed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reunion started in 1921 as the Miller-Gass reunion, but Harlans
            were part of that family. The first gathering was organized to
            celebrate Anne Miller, the last surviving child of Michael and Mary
            (Gass) Miller. That year the family members all met at a park in
            Lafayette, near Anne's home in Monon. The reunion was held in
            Lafayette for five years, until Anne died in 1926. After that, the
            reunion was held in Crawfordsville, then in Indianapolis for awhile,
            and now back in Crawfordsville for many years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many Harlans are buried in the two Oak Hill Cemeteries in
            Crawfordsville. According to Alpheus Harlan's book (p. 495), George
            (#2246) and Ruth (Gregg) Harlan emigrated to the Crawfordsville area
            from Warren County, Ohio, in 1826. George and Ruth's children were
            double Harlans because Ruth was reportedly a descendant of Michael
            Harlan. One of George and Ruth's children was Marcellas (#5711), who
            had a son named George Newton Harlan (#5711-2), who married Carrie
            Belle Snyder, granddaughter of Michael Miller.
          </p>
          <p>
            George and Carrie attended the Miller-Gass reunion (later renamed
            the Harlan-Miller reunion) for many years with their eight children:
            Charles Merle (Nina's great-grandfather), Paul Homer (grandfather of
            Harlan Record editor C.J. King), Helen Inez, Doris Kathryn, Ernest
            Carlton, Benton Miller, Austin Elwin (father of Esther Harlan Wells,
            lead organizer for the Harlan-Miller reunion), and Caretta Louise.
            The last of this generation to attend the reunion was Helen in 1991.
            Helen was an avid genealogical researcher who discovered that this
            branch of Harlans is related to Abraham Lincoln's descendants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, it is the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of George and
            Carrie who continue the reunion tradition.
          </p>
          <p>
            All Harlans are welcome to attend the 90th reunion. For more

            <a name="wright" id="wright"></a>Report from the Keeper of the
            Harlan Database
          </h2>
          <p>
            The work Alpheus Hibben Harlan did compiling and publishing the
            History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family is just amazing
            considering the means that were available at the turn of the 20th
            century for gathering information. His work has been the inspiration
            and reference for thousands of Harlans across the United States to
            do their own genealogy research. This continued genealogical pursuit
            by descendants of George and Michael has led to the accumulation of
            over 100,000 more entries on the Harlan Family Tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            A number of years ago the Harlan Family organization began an effort
            to provide a place for individual Harlans who were working on their
            personal family trees to submit their information to be included in
            a single database. Using Family Tree Maker software, Esther Harlan
            Wells entered into the program the entire contents of Alpheus' book.
            Many other Harlan genealogists then submitted their work to be
            included in the database.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, including the names from Alpheus' book, there are over
            118,000 names in the database along with a countless number of
            dates, places and facts that make genealogy research and information
            so interesting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Harlan Family tree continues to grow every day and hundreds, if
            not thousands, of people are gathering the information and writing
            it down or putting it into computer programs. If you are one of them
            and want to submit your information for inclusion in the main Harlan
            Family database, we would love to have it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data can be submitted as a computer file or on paper; either way
            works just as well. They can be mailed or e-mailed. If you have any
            questions about which computer program format works best or any
            questions about submitting your information, please contact me:

              Joel Harlan, who immigrated to California as a teenager with his
              family's wagon train, was a successful prospector in the
              California Gold Rush. He and his wife Minerva used some of their
              gold money to buy land and build this house in the San Ramon
              Valley. Finished in 1858 and nicknamed &quot;El Nido,&quot;
              meaning &quot;nest,&quot; this Gothic Revival house still stands
              on San Ramon Valley Boulevard today, but, as illustrated by these
              &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; pictures, the house needs
              to be restored. The Harlan Family in America is trying to help
              make that happen.
            </dd>
          </div>
          <p>
            In 1846, George Harlan (#852) and his extended family traveled
            overland to California from Niles, Michigan. Among the travelers was
            Joel Harlan (#2992), George's oldest son.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1852, after successful financial ventures in San Francisco and in
            the gold fields near Coloma, Calif., Joel moved to what is now San
            Ramon, east of Oakland. He built a home amid several thousand acres
            of prime agricultural land. The home, which they named &quot;El
            Nido&quot;(&quot;Nest&quot; in Spanish), remains in Harlan family
            ownership after nearly 160 years. It eventually passed to Harlan
            Geldermann, great-grandson of Joel, and is currently controlled by a
            private family trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            For several years this trust has been trying to develop the land on
            which the house stands. The City of San Ramon and the San Ramon
            Historic Foundation have been trying to find a way to secure the
            house from the Geldermann Trust and move it to another location,
            allowing the Trust to develop the 0.7 acres of very valuable land.
            The City of San Ramon has suggested some existing park sites as a
            future home for the house but somehow the cost of moving the house
            will need to be paid.
          </p>
          <p>
            The San Ramon Historic Foundation wants the house protected and
            eventually renovated since it is one of the oldest homes in the
            area. The Historic Foundation does not have the funding to commit
            and can offer only moral support for the project. The City of San
            Ramon does not want to own a historic home with no site for the home
            to be moved to. The Geldermann Trust has recently offered to pay to
            move the house and build a new foundation predicated on the approval
            of the City of San Ramon to allow development of the empty land.
          </p>
          <p>
            At its July 2010 meeting, the Harlan Family in America Board adopted
            a statement of support for the preservation of El Nido. The
            statement will be mailed to the mayor of San Ramon.

          <h3>Thomas Harlan Dead</h3>
          <p>
            Thomas Harlan, almost 84 years old, Civil War Veteran, personal
            friend of Abraham Lincoln, classmate of Robert G. Ingersoll, and
            pioneer newspaper man of the Northwest, died at the home of his son,
            Newell Harlan, East Vancouver, last Saturday.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Harlan was born September 22, 1834 [Alpheus says Sept. 23], in
            Peoria, Ill., and took up the study of law. In Iowa, in 1861, he
            married Miss Elizabeth Stearns [Sarah E. Stearns, according to
            Alpheus], a school teacher from Vermont. In 1861 he enlisted in the
            army. In 1860 General Grant appointed him Internal Revenue Collector
            for Wyoming territory and three years later he resigned to take a
            colony of settlers to the Republican River Valley in Nebraska.
            Harlan Co., Nebraska, was named after him by the State Legislature.

          <p>
            President Arthur appointed Mr. Harlan special timber agent in the
            Dakotas in 1882, and in 1889 he went to Southern Oregon to establish
            the <i>Medford Mail,</i> at Medford, Ore. In 1890, President
            Harrison appointed him special agent to investigate alleged frauds
            in land and timber claims in Oregon and Idaho. In 1894 he took up a
            homestead near Mosier, Ore. Mr. Harlan established the
            <i>White Salmon Enterprise, Rochester News, Lyle Washingtonian, </i
            >and was actively connected with several others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Harlan is survived by two sons, Newell Harlan, of Vancouver,
            Wash., and Milton Harlan, of San Francisco, and a stepson, Frank
            Ginger, who, with his mother [Marietta, Thomas's second wife], lives
            on the homestead near Mosier. There are 14 grandchildren and 7
            great-grandchildren.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Milton Harlan was publisher of the <i>Pioneer</i> from 1902 to
            1906, Thomas Harlan was connected with the paper as traveling agent
            and solicitor and thus became well acquainted with the people of
            Skamania County. A brilliant man in his younger days, Thomas Harlan
            became rather erratic and peculiar as old age crept upon him, but
            always his heart was in the right place, and he could not witness
            suffering from any cause without hastening to relieve it. Old
            settlers of this area will remember him kindly and be sorry that he
            has passed away.

            This edition of <i>The Harlan Record </i>is full of valuable
            information on the history of the Harlan Family, notifications of
            upcoming family events, and contact information to help find those
            long-lost Harlan cousins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each edition of <i>The Harlan Record </i>is put together by
            volunteers. They give of their free time to complete many valuable
            tasks. They do the research, writing and editing of the stories. The
            articles are then formulated for the layout of the newsletter and
            sent to the print shop. After the copies are printed, volunteers
            distribute them to The Harlan Family in America members.
          </p>
          <p>
            The newsletter is a year around endeavor, as stories have to be
            solicited for each edition and mailing lists need to be continuously
            updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The printing and mailing costs of <i>The Harlan Record </i>are paid
            for by donations to The Harlan Family in America. The Harlan Family
            in America also provides financial support for a number of
            worthwhile family-history-related causes, including defraying costs

            institutions preserving Harlan history.

          <p>
            Even though <i>The Harlan Record </i>is distributed free of charge,
            donations are welcomed. Each newsletter costs 75 cents to print and
            mail, or $1.50 a year for each address. The mailing list contains
            over 2,000 addresses, and currently, the costs are more than the

          <h2><a name="gcorner"></a>GENEALOGY CORNER</h2>
          <p>
            In a recent issue of a lineage society magazine called
            <i>The Colonial Courier, </i>I found an article about a new database
            that is being developed by the LDS Web site called
            <a href="http://www.familysearchlab.org/" target="_blank"
              >www.familysearchlab.org</a
            >. Try just doing a search for &quot;FamilySearchLab&quot; using
            Google or another search engine and see if it comes up. Not all of
            the databases are up to speed but it is being updated all of the
            time and the best part of the Web site is it's free! Unlike many
            research Web sites today that require a membership fee, this one has
            no charge to use. When Alice S. Ellingsberg, CG, was writing the
            article for The Colonial Courier, she was very clear that this new
            phase of FamilySearch.org is still under construction.
          </p>

            Some states' records are more accessible than others. For marriage
            records, AK, IN, LA, MA, MI and WV are most of the states that seem
            to be more complete. Digitized death records and certificates are
            available for AZ, GA, ID, LA, MI, NC, OH, SC, TX, UT and WV. Of
            course you must remember death records only date back about 100
            years, whereas marriage records have been recorded for a much longer
            period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The document collections are not limited to vital records. Census,
            land and property records, and military records are some of the
            other things that are available on a limited basis. Since more
            information is being added on a regular basis, you will need to
            check back from time to time to see if new information has been
            recorded.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do a records search you can highlight (click) on the world map
            and select the US. Then a list will appear showing what records are
            available. Also highlighted will be new records just added. Since
            this is a work in progress, I hope you all will find something
            helpful. It's been fun for me to see whom in my family I can find. I
            won't start sharing any family secrets here, but you may be
            surprised what does show up on your family.
