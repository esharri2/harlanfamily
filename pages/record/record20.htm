<p><font size=+1><b><a name=reunion></a>Still Time To Register For June's Harlan 

Family Reunion</b> </font><br><b>Thought it was too late? Haven't heard about 

it? Don't panic!</b> </p>

<p>We're holding a spot for you and your family for "Celebration 315", 

commemorating the 1687 arrival of the Harlan Family in America on the shores of 

Delaware. The four-day affair will be held June 27-30, 2002, in Wilmington, 

Delaware. </p>

<p><b>Great News!</b> Thanks to generous donations, we have made your family 

reunion family-friendly with very reasonable prices and lots of fun for all 

ages. </p>

<p><b>Highlights include: </b><br>o a spacious, comfortable hospitality room 

with refreshments, displays, the Harlan Store and more; <br>o a complimentary 

Thursday evening reception; <br>o free bus tours of Harlan sites in the gorgeous 

Brandywine Valley (seating limited); <br>o a Friday afternoon picnic with lots 

of good foods, games, rides, sports, swimming, a family talent show and more; 

<br>o informative workshops; <br>o time to tour historic and fun attractions in 

the Philadelphia region; <br>o a Saturday night banquet featuring Dan Harlan's 

short play, "Some Uncommon Kin"; <br>o a special Sunday Quaker Meeting; and 

more! <br>o a Sunday Brunch. </p>

<p><b>Sounds fabulous? <br></b>A registration kit is easy to get, and you can 

look it over with no obligation. Just e-mail a request to Ruth Harlan Lamb at <a 

href="mailto:harlamb@aol.com">harlamb@aol.com</a> or write to The Harlan Family 

in America at P.O. Box 1654, Independence, MO 64055. (If you already have a 

registration form, please fill it out and return it at your earliest 

convenience.) </p>

<p>The Doubletree Hotel in Wilmington (302-478-6000) will be Reunion 

headquarters and is the location of the opening reception and Saturday evening 

banquet. When you book your rooms, be sure to mention that you are with the 

Harlan Reunion. If we meet our room goal at the Doubletree, we'll receive a 

break on expenses. The block of rooms for Harlans will only be held until June 

3. </p>

<p>Please do us a favor by telling your Harlan relatives about the reunion and 

encourage them to join you for the most pleasant, fun time you've had in a long, 

long time. </p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you "where it all began" this June in Delaware.

    <td>

      <p>Harlan's Clothing came about through a planning meeting in St. Louis, 

      Mo., prior to the 1987 Reunion in New Castle, Del. Jim and Sue Harlan, 

      residents then of Ill., received a letter from Dan Harlan, originator of 

      the 1987 reunion. Dan asked them to attend the meeting and to bring ideas 

      for the reunion. </p>

      <p>"We took samples of golf shirts, T-shirts and baseball caps with the 

      red, black and white logo supplied by Dan. We had silk-screened items at 

      that time. Some of those shirts are still being worn by family members," 

      Sue said. Prior to the Harlan Family tour of England and Ireland, Jim and 

      Sue's children had the Coat of Arms printed for them on sweatshirts. Many 

      of the trip participants asked about, ordered and wore Harlan family items 

      on the streets of the UK. "They got a lot of attention," Sue related. </p>

      <p>During the trip, there was a meeting of folks wanting to work on a 

      future reunion in 1997. Jim and Sue decided to just enjoy the day and 

      didn't go to the meeting. At breakfast the next morning, they learned they 

      had been nominated by the group to continue with the clothing, and they 

      accepted the job. </p></td>

    <td height=302>

      <p>Prior to the reunion in Mt. Pleasant, the logo was updated, using red, 

      white and blue to be more patriotic as The Harlan Family in America. At 

      that time, Jim and Sue began offering items embroidered with the Harlan 

      Coat of Arms and now have both the Coat of Arms and The Harlan Family in 

      America logo embroidered on items. </p>

      <p>Jim and Sue decide what to sell after sending pictures and ideas to 

      Harlan reunion groups, board members and the many extended Harlan family 

      members they have in Phoenix where they now reside. They do not run a 

      commercial store; they just do custom sewing for individuals, most of the 

      time lettering sports uniforms. They hire someone else to do the 

      embroidery and silk screening. After the 1997 reunion, they bought their 

      first computer for handling orders from the family.

      width=265>

<p>Sue writes that, "We always suggest that folks e-mail or call us to see if we 

have what they want on hand." Their e-mail address is: <a 

href="mailto:JHSHDH@aol.com">JHSHDH@aol.com</a>. "We usually have lots of 

clothing in our home, but it isn't always the right size or color the customer 

wants. We usually do two big orders a year, around Christmas and prior to summer 

reunions. We give ten percent of our sales to the Family as a donation. </p>

<p>"This past year, sales have been very low. We have always tried to have 

quality products at a good price. We have decided that after the 2002 Reunion we 

will be closing The Store. Hopefully, before closing, we will be able to take 

care of all your needs and have your family dressed for the occasion. We have 

patriotic colors that we have been using, even prior to Sept. 11. "It has been 

enjoyable. The best part is meeting Harlan family all over the country. The 

challenge has been trying to decide the sizes of items to keep in stock." </p>

<p>The venture has always been financed completely by Jim and Sue. They have 

money tied in inventory, and they suggest that anyone trying such a venture 

should keep a very minimum of inventory instead of trying to have items on hand 

that you believe people will want. </p>

<p>"We have taken ideas from folks-items they were sure we would sell. Some had 

to be purchased in large numbers, and we sold very few. So we still have a lot 

of pins, patches and prints on hand," Sue said. Items sold through the store 

must have a definite Harlan connection, and some proceeds must go to the 

organization. Since the store was begun as part of the 300th Reunion, anyone who 

wants to sell items must obtain permission from the organization. </p>

<p>Jim and Sue have five children, nine living grandchildren and a great 

grandson. They had the largest group at the 1987 reunion, from Jim's parents, 

aunts, and cousins, to their children and their families, including the youngest 

child, Maureen Dugan. </p>

<p>Did you know the first issue of The Harlan Record has a preview of Alpheus 

Harlan's work? </p>

<p>Volume I, Number I, of <i>The Harlan Record</i> was published in St. Louis 

December 1, 1901. Under the title is the sentence: "Published in the Interest of 

the Harlans and Their Friends." </p>

<p>On page one of this Harlan newspaper is a short article about Alpheus H. 

Harlan (#4816), the faithful compiler of the Green Book (or red or tan, 

depending upon the publishing date), entitled <i>History and Genealogy of the 

Harlan Family</i> and in smaller print-<font size=-1><i>And Particularly of the 

Descendants of George and Michael Harlan who Settled in Chester County, Pa., 

1687.</i></font> </p>

<p>Copying from this one hundred-and-one-year-old newspaper article about 

Alpheus we read: </p>

<blockquote>

  <p><i>Hon. A. H. Harlan, of New Burlington, Ohio, the historian of the Harlan 

  family, has for the last twenty years been devoting his time to the 

  preparation of a volume which, when finished, promises to be one of the most 

  complete compilations of history and incidents relating to the descendants of 

  George and Michael Harlan that was ever before attempted by any one.</i></p>

  <p><i>This work, which we understand will be ready for publication in the very 

  early future, will be as near a perfect history of the Harlan family as could 

  well be conceived, and, coming from the pen of the recognized historian of the 

  family, cannot fail to be all that is expected of such work. </i></p>

  <p><i>The Harlan Record being intended as a medium through which may be 

  cultivated a closer relationship between the Harlans and their friends 

  everywhere, does not pretend to take the place of or in any way imitate this 

  most valuable history. We congratulate the members of our family upon the 

  prospect of this great work and hope soon to be able to say something about it 

  after an inspection of its pages. </i></p></blockquote>

<p>I noticed the article on Malvina Harlan's memoirs in your latest Harlan 

Record. You will be pleased to know that the memoirs will be reprinted by the 

Modern Library, a division of Random House, May 7, 2002. </p>

<p>I'm forwarding a quote, sent by the publishers, by Stacy Schiff, 

Pulitzer-prize winning author of Vera (Mrs. Vladimi Nabokov): </p>

<p>"I'm pleased to share this advance quote for Some Memories: 'Malvina Harlan's 

are the observations you wish they wouldn't leave out of history books. A 

charming slice of domestic-and national- history, worth the price of admission 

for the story of the disappearing Dred Scott inkstand alone. Mrs. Harlan was one 

wise woman.'" </p>

<p>Excuse the self-promotion, but here's a bit of a review of my book, available 

at <a href="http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/">http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/</a> </p>

<p>Review of Linda Przybyszewski, The Republic According to John Marshall Harlan 

(Univ. of North Carolina Press, 1999), by Stanley N. Katz, Woodrow Wilson 

School, Princeton University: "Linda Przybyszewski's volume on 'the first 

Justice Harlan,' John Marshall Harlan (1833-1911), deserves a place on the 

library shelf that holds the finest recent examples of the genre: Gerald 

Gunther's Learned Hand, Andrew Kaufman's Benjamin Cardozo or, a little further 

back, R. Kent Newmyer's Joseph Story. I could name other candidates, but I want 

to make clear that Przybyszewski belongs on this special shelf. </p>

<p>"Or does it? I could make the argument that the Przybyszewski volume deserves 

a shelf all to itself, since it is such a wonderfully innovative approach to 

judicial (and especially United States Supreme Court) biography." </p>

<p>So maybe you'll want to look at it too.</p>

<p><a name=Murillo></a><b>The Story of Murillo &amp; Jim Bob</b> <b>as told by 

Ralph D. Reynolds</b> <br>After the death of Murillo Elizabeth Harlan Smith, a 

former member of the Harlan Ninety Plus Club, an interesting story of her life 

surfaced. </p>

<p>Murillo's father, James Henry Harlan (#6058), was born in 1839 and served in 

the Civil War with Hood's Alabama Brigade, fighting in eight major battles, 

never wounded. He fought against Captain Arthur MacArthur, General Douglas 

MacArthur's father, at the Battle of Missionary Ridge. Captain Arthur MacArthur 

was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his action that day. James 

Henry played dead until dark, and then ran away to fight another day. </p>

<p>James and his first wife, Sarah, had nine children. The family moved to Texas 

in 1883 and attended the Blue Ridge Baptist Church in Reagan. The church 

organized in 1859 on land donated by George Harlan (#2405). </p>

<p>In 1897, Sarah died, and James later married Williean Spurgeon Mathews in 

1902. Williean had a daughter by a previous marriage, and in the 1918 flu 

epidemic, both the daughter and Williean died, leaving five children from the 

second marriage, one of whom was Murillo, born in 1908. </p>

      <b>Murillo, age 15 </b></td>

    <td height=591>

      <p>Murillo was named after a famous Civil War ballad. She and a neighbor 

      boy became parents of a son in 1925, and despite family pressure to marry, 

      Murillo refused. She went to Pilot Point (Texas) Rest Cottage for the 

      birth of her son, named Jim Bob Harlan, and he was put up for adoption. 

      </p>

      <p>The first day the infant was on display, Maggie Reynolds saw him and 

      fell in love. The baby, Jim Bob, had a big grin, and she chose him for her 

      child. He was renamed Ralph Douglas Reynolds, after his adoptive father. 

      </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Murillo married an abusive bootlegger, and they had two 

      children. After he was sent to prison for life, she divorced him. To 

      support her two children during the Depression, she became a bootlegger. 

      Several relatives say they would have starved if it hadn't been for 

      Murillo. </p>

      <p>She later married Glen Smith, and they moved to California in the 

      mid-1930s, where they worked in a laundry. Glen was drafted in the Army 

      during World War II, was captured at the Battle of the Bulge, and was a 

      POW in Germany. Eventually he returned to Murillo but was so shell-shocked 

      that he couldn't hold a job. </p>

      <p>The child Murillo Harlan gave up, now Ralph Douglas Reynolds, graduated 

      from Tyler (Texas) High School in 1942 and married Virginia Lee Ellis in 

      April of 1943. He joined the Navy in September and served in the Naval 

      weather bureau. </p>

      <p>After his discharge in 1946, he worked for the weather bureau and then 

      for the U.S. Army in Arizona as a research meteorologist. He transferred 

      to stratospheric balloon research for the Air Force, which included four 

      manned balloon missions. In 1962 he transferred to the Army Atmospheric 

      Science Lab at the White Sands Missile Range and finished a degree in 

      Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics in 1966. He held various positions in 

      several states and retired from the Physical Sciences Laboratory, New 

      Mexico State University, in 1991.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

      natural parents. With Ralph's permission to search for and obtain the 

      release of his adoption papers, Sue got in touch with Ralph's birth 

      mother, Murillo Harlan Smith. After talking by phone, Murillo and her son 

      were reunited, and Ralph describes it as "love at first sight." The two 

      were able to share her last 20 years of life. The families of both Murillo 

      and Ralph got together several times a year, and the children and 

      grandchildren adored their newfound relative. </p>In October of 1999, 

      Murillo, nearly 91 and an Oklahoma resident, wanted to attend the annual

      nephew agreed to accompany her. But she collapsed just as they got to the

<p align=left><b><a name=journey></a>A HARLAN FAMILY JOURNEY by Cynthia Rhoades, 

Hagerstown, Indiana</b> <br></p>

<p align=left>In looking for clues on the migration route of Aaron #41 and his 

family, I found a list of early tax records (1755) for Orange County, N.C., 

which included Aaron Harling; Valentine Hollingsworth, Aaron's father-in-law and 

father of Sarah Hollingsworth; as well as Joseph, Steven and Thomas Howard, 

names that appear frequently with the Harlans as they moved from place to place. 

</p>

<p align=left>The history of Union County, S.C., tells that relocation to South 

Carolina started around 1751, encouraged by the availability of free frontier 

land. The Treaty of 1755 between South Carolina Governor James Glen and Old Hop 

(the principal Cherokee chief) accelerated this migration. </p>

<p align=left>Among the early Union County settlers were English Quakers and 

Baptists. The Quakers established two churches: Padgett's Creek and Cane Creek. 

Some of these early Quaker families included the Gists and Hollingsworths. Many 

Union County Quakers left between 1800 and 1810, moving on to Ohio and Indiana 

because they objected to the large-scale slavery being developed in the area. 

</p>

<p align=left>A group of Separate Baptists arrived in Union County from North 

Carolina and settled on the Broad River in 1759. In 1762 the congregation moved 

up Fairforest Creek to Dining Creek, in southwestern Union County. This 

Fairforest Baptist Church was the first Baptist church in the South Carolina 

up-country. Families in this group included Phillip Mulkey, Obediah and Stephen 

Howard, Benjamin Gist and others. </p>

<p align=left>Aaron Harlin is listed as a resident of the "Old 96th District" in 

South Carolina in 1779, in records compiled as a type of census. The Old 96th 

District, created from parts of the original seven judicial districts, included 

Union County, which wasn't created until 1798. </p>

<p align=left>We now have new information about the date of Aaron's death in 

Union District, S.C., in November, 1796, based on Letters of Administration of 

the estate of Aaron Harlan. Aaron's estate was administered by three of his 

sons: Samuel #195, George #197 and Jacob #198. The list of Aaron's estate 

includes two tracts of land to be sold, one with 205 acres and the other with 

183. Besides the animals and farm equipment, the household goods were also 

listed. &gt;From that, one must presume Sarah had preceded Aaron in death. 

Alpheus Harlan's <i>History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family</i> confirms 

this, although no date is given. Sarah reportedly died in Laurens District, part 

of the "Old 96th District." </p>

<p align=left>We know that Aaron's son, James #199, and his wife, Edith Howard, 

left South Carolina in 1799 with their six children, which included Valentine 

#736, Elihu #737, Joshua #738, John #739, Jacob #740 and Nathan #741. They 

traveled first to the area of Pigeon Creek, Tenn., staying for about a year, 

then moving on to what was then Barren County, Ky., but in 1820, became part of 

Monroe County. </p>

<p align=left>According to the meeting minutes, a church called Mill Creek 

Baptist Church, or Old Mulkey Meeting House, had been established in 1798. A 

small band of pioneer Baptists from North and South Carolina established the 

church led by Phillip Mulkey. John Mulkey was the first preacher of record. 

Among its members were James Harlan and his wife, who joined the church in March 

of 1800, as well as Gists and Howards and other Harlans. </p>

<p align=left>Old Mulkey Meeting House is now a State Historic Site and is 

located near the town of Tompkinsville, Ky., close to the Tennessee state line. 

The current building was built in 1804, during a period of religious revival. 

</p>

<p align=left>By 1809, a large congregation worshipped in the log meeting house. 

A controversy arose over the teachings of John Mulkey, leading to several heresy 

trials. Failing to gain a majority vote against him, the church decided to 

"choose sides." The majority who believed as Mulkey did continued to worship in 

the church, which became known as "Old Mulkey." The other congregation built the 

Second Mill Creek Baptist Church. </p>

<p align=left>A copy of the land grant to James Harlan, for 135 acres in Barren 

County, dated January 1804, indicates James purchased land in 1804. The grant 

states that one boundary of the parcel is the east fork of the Big Barren River, 

and another boundary starts at a white oak tree on John Mulkey's line. That 

property boundary is one more link or proof that James was living in Kentucky 

prior to his journey on to Indiana. </p>

<p align=left>He is also listed on the 1810 Federal Census in Barren County, 

along with his wife and nine children, six males and three females. By 1810, 

James #742, Edith #743, Polly #744, and Anna #745 had all been born and were 

part of the family. Since James' son Valentine was 23 by then, we can presume he 

was no longer living at home. </p>

<p align=left>According to the history of the Harlan Family, James and his 

family lived in Barren County until 1817, when they moved to Darke County, Ohio, 

where James and Edith lived until their deaths. James is actually credited with 

settling the town of Bethel, Ind., in 1817, across the state line from Darke 

County, Ohio. The town was actually called Crossroads until 1844, when it was 

renamed Bethel after the Bethel Christian Church, established in 1827.</p>

<p align=left>In the meantime, James' son, John #739, had moved to Union County, 

Ind, circa 1813-1815. There are two land entries for a John Harlan. One is dated 

April, 1813, and the other is March, 1815, but the actual copies of those land 

entries have not been confirmed. What is certain is that John married Catherine 

Brown Harlan on October 13, 1815, by James Lewiston, the Justice of the Peace in 

Franklin County, Ind. Franklin County is just south of Union County. </p>

<p align=left>John and Catherine appear to have bought and sold a lot of land 

while they lived in Union County with the last parcel being sold in May of 1851. 

&gt;From there they moved to Iowa, where they lived the rest of their lives. 

(<i>Several from my line had the opportunity to visit the Iowa grave site during 

the 1987 Harlan Reunion, thanks to one member</i>.) </p>

<p align=left>John and Catherine's son, George #2508, was born in Union County, 

Ind., in 1818, just two years after Indiana became a state. George married 

Malinda Stevens in Union County in November of 1841. They raised ten children 

and remained in Union County their entire lives. </p>

<p align=left>One interesting note is that George was elected a trustee of the 

Brownsville Christian Church in 1846. Somewhere along the line, the family 

became members of the Christian Church, as George's grandfather was also 

credited with establishing a Christian Church in Bethel, Ind. The 1860 Indiana 

census lists George as a farmer with property valued at $12,000 and personal 

property worth $2,000. Contrary to what the <i>History and Genealogy of the 

Harlan Family</i> reports, George died on July 26, 1903, and Malinda died 

October 27, 1904. </p>

<p align=left>Their son and my great-grandfather, John Franklin #6326, was born 

in 1844. He is the last of my direct line to be listed in the History and 

Genealogy of the Harlan Family. I think the value of my efforts in both Warren 

County and Clark County is that they illustrate how the genealogy book really 

only tells part of the story. There is no substitute for going to the scene and 

checking out other resources to get a more complete picture of what our 

ancestors were up to. Information that might not have been important to Alpheus 

in 1914, or that might have been thought boastful or scandalous, may not appear 

that way at all today. </p>

<p align=left><b><a name="Native America"></a>Harlans Have Native America 

Connection</b> </p>

<p align=left>Some Harlan kin are members of the Omaha Tribe, located on a 

reservation outside the city of Omaha, Neb. Major T. L. Harlan relates that "we 

produced the first female Indian Doctor," and several of our kinsmen are members 

of the Tribe, including Joe Harlan, Sr., who is quite active in social events. 

</p>

<p align=left>For anyone wanting to connect their Native American roots to 

Alpheus Harlan's genealogy, the early 1800s U. S. Census in Nebraska showed 

Indian Harlans in Omaha. In 1892, about a dozen Harlans were living on the 

Reservation, according to the U.S. Census Bureau records, copies of which are 

available from the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. </p></div>

<p align=left><b><a name=echoes></a>Echoes of Andersonville - Part One By Edward 

Harlan Wynn</b>, <b>Contributing Editor </b>

<p align=left>By the winter of 1863-64, the Confederacy was near the last of its 

resources and manpower. Knowing this, Union General Ulysses S. Grant refused to 

continue the prisoner-exchange agreement that had been in operation during most 

of the war. This action cut down on the number of Confederate soldiers Grant's 

army would have to face in the coming campaign, but it also meant death to a 

great number of Union prisoners who would otherwise have been exchanged. 

<p align=left>The concentration of war prisoners in Richmond, Va., drained the 

local food supply and was a source of danger should the Yankees attack. To 

relieve the burden, a new prison site was selected in the heart of Georgia, near 

the village of Andersonville, in Sumter County. The prison was officially named 

Camp Sumter. 

<p align=left>When the first prisoners arrived in late February, 1864, they 

found 16.5 acres of open land enclosed by a 15-foot-tall stockade. The 

not-yet-completed prison provided little in the way of housing, clothing, or 

medical care. The only fresh water was a stream that flowed through the prison 

yard, with the downstream end serving as the camp latrine. 

<p align=left>During the next few months, 400 more prisoners arrived each day, 

and in June the prison was expanded to 26 acres. By then, there were 26,000 men 

enclosed in an area intended to hold 10,000. By August, the prison contained 

more than 32,000 Union prisoners. 

<p align=left>Conditions at Andersonville were worse than at any other war 

prison, North or South. The Georgia heat, along with disease, filth, exposure, 

and lack of adequate medical care, took a fearful toll. 

<p align=left>In September 1864, General William T. Sherman's Union army 

captured Atlanta and brought its cavalry within reach of Andersonville. The 

Confederacy relocated surviving prisoners to other camps, and Camp Sumter 

operated as a smaller facility for the rest of the war. But the summer had taken 

a terrible toll: of the 45,000 Union soldiers confined at Camp Sumter, 13,000 

died, including several Harlan men. 

<p align=left>Wilbur Fisk Massey (#6787, son of Matilda Harlan #2712) was a fair 

complexioned 27-year-old teacher with blue eyes and light hair when he enlisted 

as a Private in Company D, 111th Regiment, Illinois Volunteer Infantry. He 

enlisted in Xenia, Ill., on August 11, 1862, for a period of three years. On 

November 5, 1863, he was reported missing in an action against a guerrilla force 

at Gravel Springs, Ala. 

<p align=left>Confederate records listed him on December 3, 1863, as a prisoner 

of war confined at Richmond, Va. He was sent to the prison camp at Andersonville 

in February, 1864, and was reported confined there on March 25. On May 15, 1864, 

he was admitted to the Hospital at Andersonville, where he died on May 28 of 

diarrhea, according to the Prisoner of War Records housed in the National 

Archives. The list of interments at Andersonville indicates that Wilbur is 

buried in Grave #1428. 

<p align=left>Another young Illinois man, James C. Harlan (#6959), son of Jehu 

(#2751) and Rachel Sutton, was only 19 years old at the time of his enlistment 

in the Union army. His home was in Table Grove, Ill., where he farmed. At the 

time of his enlistment he was described as 5 feet 9 inches tall with a fair 

complexion, gray eyes and brown hair. 

<p align=left>James was a farm boy who provided his own horse and horse-related 

equipment when he signed up as a Private in Company L, 7th Regiment, Illinois 

Cavalry. For a time he served as the Blacksmith for his unit, for which he 

received an additional .40 per day. 

<p align=left>On October 11, 1863, during a charge near Collierville, Tenn., his 

horse was shot, and he was captured. Records reflect that he was confined in 

Richmond, Va. On March 21, 1864, he was sent to the prison camp at 

Andersonville. He was admitted to the hospital at Andersonville on July 22, 

1864, where he died on August 24. The cause of James' death is listed as 

"Scorbutus" in existing records. James is buried in grave #6684. (<i>To be 

continued in next issue</i>) <br>

<p align=left><b><a name="post card"></a>Post Card Has Mysterious Origin</b> 

<p align=left>Liz Harlan Sly found a post card in her belongings. It is a 

picture of Edward Harlan Stever, aged one year, and was addressed to Liz's 

grandfather, George W. Harlan, 244 St. Charles, Atlanta, Ga., who lived at this 

address in the early 1900s. The card was unstamped and probably not mailed. 

<p align=left>The card has a photographer's identification: "Reid Studio, 

Ottumwa, Iowa." The message is: <i>"This is Harlan at a year. It's fine of him 

except his hair. It is curly but after he wears his hood a while, it looks 

stringy &#8230; We are all well and busy. Expecting to spend New Years with Eula 

&#8230;"</i> 

<p align=left>The signature is "Lillie B. Stever, Batavia, Iowa." Liz will be 

happy to send this picture to a descendant. Her address is 18 Ravine Drive, 

Woodcliff Lake, NJ 07677, or you may contact her at <a

<p align=left><b><a name=Texas></a>Texas May Day Singing to be May 5</b> 

<p>The 115th annual May Day Singing will be held at the Blue Ridge Baptist 

Church on Sunday, May 5. The church is located about 40 miles southeast of Waco 

on FM-1771. The church was organized in 1859 on land donated by George Harlan 

(#2405) which was granted to his father from Mexico, and the cemetery is filled 

with Harlan descendants and spouses. There will be singing from 10:00 until 

noon, followed by a covered dish lunch. Singing will then continue until 3:00pm.

<p align=left><b><a name=restoring></a>Restoring Historical Harlan 

Buildings</b></p>

<p align=left>&#8226; The Monterey County (CA) Historical Society is in the process of 

restoring the former home of Benjamin Caleb Harlan (#9335) in Salinas. The 1890s 

house is historic since it is one of the early examples of a collaboration 

between an owner, builder and architect. It has classic examples of a master 

carpenter&#8217;s craft and early prefabricated parts. The Society is seeking any 

photographs of the house to assist in the restoration, as well as photos of 

Benjamin and his family. The house was saved from demolition in 1989 and was 

moved to the Boronda Adobe History Center. Anyone with photos or information can 

contact the executive director of the Historical Society at <a

<p align=left>&#8226; The city of Marshall, Iowa, has purchased an opera house built 

in 1871 and named Harlan Hall for its builder, Howard Harlan (#2262). The hall 

has recently been added to the National Register of Historic Places. Howard was 

a businessman, builder, owner of the Sherman House hotel and a brick livery 

stable with the opera hall above. The city of Marshall plans to make the hall 

into a community center, with a theater upstairs. They intend to have a small 

museum above the hall, housed on an original balcony, and perhaps an 

interpretive center about the heritage of the National Road. If anyone would 

like a tour of Harlan Hall to see the work in progress, contact the secretary of 

the City of Marshall, Iowa, at 217-826-8087, Monday-Friday. <br></p>
