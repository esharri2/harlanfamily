        /><br />
        Our history tends to focus on the deeds of our Anglo male ancestors,
        perhaps because we Anglo males pretty much ran the show for so many
        decades. Perhaps from time to time we should also take a moment to
        examine the struggles and contributions of our female ancestors.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In this short article, I would like to note the contribution of my
        great-great grandmother, Eliza Harlan (#2871). Eliza (1814-1897)
        overcame many serious life crises with remarkable courage and success.
        She was also the mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, and great-great
        grandmother to many remarkable Harlans.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        For purpose of orientation, let me first provide you with Eliza&#146;s
        background. Eliza was descended from the following members of the Harlan
        family: our original immigrant, George (#3), who was a Quaker and came
        to America in 1687; James (#11), who moved his family from Pennsylvania
        to Virginia, probably around 1735; George (#45), who established his
        family at the Spring Hill Farm in West Virginia, still occupied by
        George&#146;s descendants; George&#146;s oldest son, Jehu (#212), who
        probably became a Presbyterian and certainly by his will helped
        establish the Falling Waters Presbyterian church in Spring Mills, W.Va.;
        and Elijah (#824). (Incidentally, Elijah&#146;s brother was Justice John
        Marshall Harlan&#146;s grandfather.)
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Elijah moved to Tennessee shortly after his father&#146;s death in 1806.
        About the same time, a William Sims moved from Hanover County, Virginia,
        to Tennessee. William was married to Judy Cross. They had a number of
        children, including a daughter named Elizabeth. In 1811, Elijah Harlan
        met and married Elizabeth Sims. Eliza, the subject of this story, was
        one of their children.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Four years before this marriage, in 1807, Judy Cross Sims&#146; brother,
        Oliver Cross, left his wife in Virginia and moved to Tennessee. His son,
        Joseph Oliver Cross, went to Tennessee with him.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1827 Eliza Harlan married Joseph Oliver Cross. She was only thirteen
        years old at the time of her marriage. She bore him five children, the
        first one, Sarah Anne, being born in 1828.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        At that time Tennessee seemed to be the right place to live. It was at
        the heart of the nation&#146;s economic development and political power.
        Tennessee&#146;s Andrew Jackson had recently served two terms as
        President of the United States; James K. Polk had just been elected
        Governor of Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        By 1836 Eliza&#146;s grandfather, William Sims, was a successful planter
        and businessman. Eliza&#146;s husband Joseph Oliver Cross owned over 25
        slaves and was a successful farmer.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        There were, however, potential problems. With no &#147;vaccination&#148;
        against disease, the threat of epidemic was omnipresent. Also, there
        were no governmental &#147;safety nets&#148; to assist those without
        financial resources.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1839 a small pox epidemic hit Maury County, Tennessee. At the time,
        Joseph and Eliza and their children were living in Mt. Pleasant, Tenn.
        The epidemic quickly killed Joseph. Eliza&#146;s mother and Eliza&#146;s
        children also became ill. On August 21, 1839, Elizabeth Sims Harlan
        wrote her will; four days later she died. Four of Eliza&#146;s children,
        Sarah Anne, James Fleming, Jehu and Isabela survived, but one daughter,
        Elizabeth, also died.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Eliza was left with four children. She boarded her children with William
        Tannehill. The relationship appeared to be an &#147;arms length&#148;
        one. William came from a prominent Southern family. His brother,
        Ninnian, owned an iron works facility that ultimately produced much of
        the iron for the Confederacy. William&#146;s sister was married to a
        Calhoun, related to John C. Calhoun, the former Vice President of the
        United States.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In time&#151;I don&#146;t know exactly when&#151;William and
        Eliza&#146;s relationship evolved from &#147;arm&#146;s length&#148; to
        &#147;hands on.&#148; On February 5, 1841, they were married.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a result, Sarah Anne Cross met Eliza&#146;s nephew-in-law, Joseph
        Calhoun. They married in 1842.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Eliza Harlan Cross Tannehill&#146;s children sometimes tested her
        resolve. For instance, in 1846 her son James Fleming Cross ran away from
        home and joined the Eutaw Rangers to fight in the Mexican War. Eliza
        could not stop him. James&#146; independent spirit, however, was but a
        minor hiccup in her life&#146;s story.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On January 29, 1847, William Tannehill loaded all the produce from his
        plantation on a steamboat, the &#147;Tuscaloosa.&#148; It left the wharf
        at Mobile, Ala., about 8:00 in the evening on its way to Tuscaloosa. As
        the ship proceeded up the river, two of her boilers exploded, and
        William was killed.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Soon thereafter Eliza moved with her two brothers, Jehu Harlan and
        William Sims Harlan, to Knoxubee County, Mississippi. She remained
        responsible for the care of three children, James, Jehu, and Isabela,
        but she was without a husband or a job (there were few good jobs for
        women outside the home in those days).
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        But never fear. In 1848, our heroine married again, this time to a very
        prosperous merchant by the name of Sam Dunlap.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        As previously mentioned, the threat of disease was omnipresent. In 1850
        Eliza&#146;s daughter Isabela died from &#147;consumption.&#148;
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Her son James returned from the Mexican War, and in 1852 he married
        Margaret Rose Dunlap, Sam&#146;s daughter by a prior marriage. Sam owned
        a home in Eutah, Ala., and property near Clinton. James and his new wife
        Margaret took up residence on the property in Clinton and began to raise
        a family. Eliza Harlan Cross Tannehill Dunlap always married well.
        Apparently, with her help, so did her children.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Eliza&#146;s sons, James and Jehu, both fought for the Confederacy, and
        both survived. But the Civil War changed the entire deck of cards for
        almost everyone. James and Jehu lost their slaves. Sam Dunlap lost his
        business.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1833 one of Eliza&#146;s relatives, first cousin Nicholas P. Sims,
        had moved from Tennessee to Waxahachie, Texas, where he constructed a
        log cabin, began to farm, and prospered. He may have encouraged Sam and
        Eliza to move to Texas, where there seemed to be a good future.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1867 Sam and Eliza moved with their four children, and perhaps with a
        grandchild, to Dallas County, Texas; in 1868, they moved to Waxahachie,
        Ellis County, Texas.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Sam began to rebuild his business, but he did not live long. He died in
        1872.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On December 12, 1877, Eliza married her first cousin Nicholas P. Sims.
        Nicholas was by that time one of the richest men in Ellis County.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Eliza died 20 years later, on June 15, 1897. One of her obituaries (full
        of errors) stated she and Nicholas had been lovers when they were young,
        in Tennessee! Perhaps, if true, it was just a Platonic love.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Before his death, Nicholas P. and Eliza Sims&#146;s son, Judge Oscar
        Dunlap, provided for the creation of a library in Waxahachie, Texas. On
        April 24, 2005, the Nicholas P. Sims Library celebrated its 100th
        anniversary.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        During her lifetime, Eliza gave birth to nine children. She was 14 when
        she had her first child. At age 46, when she gave birth to her youngest
        child, she already had 16 grandchildren. She was 83 when she died.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Like many women, she encountered plenty of hardships and survived. While
        her struggles are not recorded in traditional history books, her legacy
        includes a number of distinguished descendants whose accomplishments are
        recorded.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        For instance, her son Oscar Dunlap became a prominent banker, judge, and
        powerful political figure in Texas after World War I. Ely Green, a
        mulatto who was Oscar&#146;s chauffeur, wrote an autobiography,
        <i>Too Black, Too White</i> (available on &lt; amazon.com &gt;), which
        he dedicated to Judge Dunlap, hero of the book. It provides an excellent
        portrait of the judge and of race relations in Texas during the 1920s.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Eliza&#146;s grandson, Oliver Harlan Cross, led opposition to the Ku
        Klux Klan in Central Texas in the 1920s and served as U.S. Congressman
        from 1928-1936.

    </p>
    <p>
      The annual board meeting of The Harlan Family in America was held April 23
      at the Clarion Hotel Mansion Inn in Sacramento, Calif. Twenty-eight board
      members and visitors were present. Many thanks go to Joe and LaRena Hannon
      for making all the arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among items discussed was the announcement of a new link on the Harlan Web
      site, maintained by Steve Harrison and entitled &#147;Names Upon the
      Land.&#148; It contains places across the United States with the name of
      &#147;Harlan.&#148; We would like for people to take pictures of Harlan
      sites and send to board member William K. Harlan (address on page 5,
      center column).
    </p>
    <p>
      The association discussed and approved making an annual donation of $500
      to the &#147;Friends of the Harlan-Lincoln House&#148; project at Iowa
      Wesleyan College, Mount Pleasant, Iowa.
    </p>

      The Nugget Hotel Contract was reviewed for deadline dates and to begin
      planning for letters to be sent regarding the next National Harlan Reunion
      in Reno (Nev.) from July 11-15, 2007. Bob Harlan, president, reported that
      we could obtain about 1,208 Harlan names and addresses from 13 western
      states to be used to send letters to unknown Harlans in these states. The
      board approved the purchase of the list, and those addressees received a
      special mailing this summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reunion committees were discussed, and many volunteered to work on the
      various committees. Pat Fluetsch (CA) and William K. Harlan (CA)
      volunteered to serve as Co-chairpersons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat and William visited Reno July 5&#150;6 to talk with Nugget
      representatives, the Convention and Visitors Bureau contact, and they
      visited several attractions in the area to consider for inclusion in the
      reunion plans.

    </p>
    <p>
      Tim was raised by a mother who believed that boys should know how to cook,
      sew and clean. Tim worked so hard on the cooking that he missed the sewing
      and cleaning lessons. He is a three-time winner of the Soulard Cajun
      Creole Cook-off in St. Louis (see <i>Harlan Record</i>, Spring 1999) and
      has authored a 100-page cookbook that contains 400 family recipes. He and
      his wife, Linda, have traveled numerous times to New Orleans and the Bayou
      Country of Louisiana.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourteen years ago, at age ten, their son, Brook, began by preparing his
      own menu and then taking orders to cook Christmas breakfast. In high
      school, he worked in restaurants and took home-economics-type courses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at age 24, he is a four-year graduate of the Culinary Institute of
      America in Hyde Park, N.Y. Recently he was selected as one of eight
      finalists from a field of 10,000 entries to participate in &#147;The Next
      Food Network Star&#148; which recently aired on the Food Network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brook completed his culinary internship at the popular restaurant,
      Commander&#146;s Palace, in the New Orleans Garden District. After
      graduation from CIA, he returned to his hometown of Columbia, Mo., to
      teach Culinary Arts at Rock Bridge High School. He is also assistant
      wrestling coach at the school. The father &#150; son team often prepares

    <p>
      <i>(Editor&#146;s Note: The Spring 2005 issue of </i>The Harlan Record<i>
        featured an edited version of a long article on the years that George
        and Michael Harland spent in Ireland. Based on extensive research done
        by one of our cousins, John H. Harland, of Kelowna, British Columbia,
        this includes information about Quakerism and Irish history. We promised
        to print more of his findings, and here is part two. The remainder of
        John&#146;s interesting account can be accessed through the link,
        &#147;Irish Interlude&#148; on the Harlan Web site.)</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Part One of the Irish Interlude recounted some early struggles to control
      the island of Ireland. To recap, after several powerful Irish earls and
      their supporters fled from Ireland in 1607, England&#146;s King James I
      attempted to further dissipate the Irish rebellion by confiscating land
      and granting it to those &#147;undertakers&#148; who promised to bring
      English settlers to Ireland. The Irish did not welcome these changes. Some
      Irish dissenters were sold off as slaves to the West Indies, some took to
      the hills and continued to foment rebellion, and others became laborers
      for the new masters. Records show that some Harlands settled in these
      confiscated lands, and if these Harlands were related to George and
      Michael, it would have given the two brothers a reason to settle in
      northern Ireland, near Lurgan, in the county of Armagh, in the province of
      Ulster.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, King James lived in dread of further Catholic
      conspiracy, and there was widespread apprehension that at any moment the
      Earl of Tyrone would land back in Ireland with an invading Spanish army,
      and reclaim his hereditary lands. On the one hand, while this made the
      authorities keen to establish planters, worry about Tyrone discouraged
      settlers from coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1641, rebellion broke out again, but this occurred while the English
      were distracted by Civil War between Parliament and King Charles I, and
      consequently things went badly for the English. In the part of Ireland
      relevant to our story, Irish troops under Sir Phelim O&#146;Neill and Sir
      Conn Magennis captured several towns, and by superior tactics defeated the
      Scottish general Robert Munro at the Battle of Benburb in 1642. Atrocities
      and counter-atrocities followed, with some settlers being killed, and
      others becoming discouraged and returning to England. The Plantation in
      Munster, initiated by Queen Elizabeth, never recovered from this setback,
      but in Ulster the number of planters was to rebound after the uprising had
      been quelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1649, having dealt with affairs in England and Scotland, Oliver
      Cromwell landed in Ireland determined to crush the rebels once and for
      all. This &#145;pacification&#146; was executed with such signal brutality
      that Cromwell&#146;s name remains anathema in Ireland to this day.
      Following the defeat of the Irish at Limerick in 1650, the estates of the
      rebels were confiscated and used by Cromwell to pay off his army. As to
      the indigenous Irish, they were to be driven out &#133; in Cromwell&#146;s
      phrase sent &#147;to Hell or to Connacht.&#148; Of special relevance to us
      is the land he seized in the Barony of Lower Iveagh, and awarded to troops
      serving under Colonel John Barrett. This land included the Parish of
      Donaghcloney. [&#145;Church of the Meadow&#146;. Alpheus Harlan
      consistently misspelled the name as &#145;Donnalong&#146;]. The common
      soldiers sold their shares to Col. Barrett, who in turn transferred his
      interest to another Cromwellian officer, William Waring.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the Waring estate that the Harland brothers settled when they
      arrived from England, and although we cannot establish a specific date for
      this, given the occurrence of their names on Quaker records, we can say it
      preceded 1678. Although Alpheus Harlan does not specify an exact location,
      my guess is that they settled in the townland of Corcreeny, which lies
      almost due south of Lurgan and a bit west of Waringstown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Net Population shift: There were ups and downs in the numbers of planters,
      but with a net gain over time. Fluctuations depended partly on the
      competence of the undertaker, his ability to attract settlers, and the
      fertility of the land; but also on those pressures existing where the
      settlers came from, tending to drive them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance the Brothers came to Ireland at a time when Quakers were
      being given a hard time in Durham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Economic factors played a huge part, and the Brothers were pulled rather
      than pushed, leaving Lurgan when things were in fact going fairly well
      there. Indeed they left just prior to the rise in the general prosperity
      that followed the establishment of the linen industry in and around the
      town. Over the next two centuries the cultivation of flax and manufacture
      of linen were to exert a major effect on the economy of the area and the
      Province. This was a side effect of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes
      in 1685, which resulted in wholesale emigration of the Huguenots, and the
      expulsion from France of an important class of entrepreneurs and skilled
      tradesmen. France&#146;s loss was Ireland&#146;s gain, and in a way, it
      was analogous to the expulsion of a talented segment of the population by
      the Third Reich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting about 1717, a steady trickle of people left Ulster, and gradually
      this increased to a torrent, which was only interrupted by the War of
      Independence in 1776. With numbers peaking in the early 1770s, somewhere
      around 200,000 folk emigrated from Ulster to the American Colonies, and it
      is claimed that in 1790, of the nearly half million folk in America who
      were of Irish stock, two-thirds derived from Ulster.
    </p>
    <p>
      The egress resulted from large families and rapid growth of population in
      Ulster, outflow increasing when there were poor harvests or a downturn in
      the linen industry, and decreasing when the local economy picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scots-Irish, as American historians refer to this group, arrived in
      America with perhaps the perfect mind-set for an immigrant at that
      particular juncture in the history of a young nation. Frontiersmen were
      pushing their way westward from the early settlements, like that on the
      Delaware, which had attracted the Brothers; and the new arrivals, with
      their built-in &#147;Settler Mentality,&#148; were perfectly suited to the
      task of opening up potentially hostile territory. In Ireland they had
      learnt how to farm their land, while keeping an eye on the surrounding
      hills, alert for the descent of marauders intent on burning the barns and
      driving off the cattle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, they brought with them a tradition of political radicalism
      and distrust, which influenced political affairs leading to the War of
      Independence. Eight out of 56 signers of the Declaration of Independence
      were Ulstermen by birth or one generation away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emigration recommenced after 1783, but after about 1830, the Ulster
      emigrants were outnum-bered by Irish from other parts of the Island. As a
      consequence of the Irish Famine at the middle of the 19th century, it is
      estimated that one million people died, and a further three million left
      Ireland for good, many of them coming to America. Ireland was changed
      utterly by this depopulation.

    </p>
    <p>
      Did U. S. Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan (1833-1911) have a
      half-brother who was a black man raised as a slave? Through the years,
      rumors have persisted that there was a family connection between the two,
      though no family records support this view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert James Harlan (1816-1897) lived in the Harlan household, was
      light-skinned and was treated differently than the family&#146;s other
      slaves. He received an education and was permitted to go to California to
      seek his fortune in the 1848 gold rush. After moving to Ohio, he worked in
      real estate, operated a photography studio and served in the Ohio
      legislature.<br />
      <br />
      To settle the matter, attorney Robert Harlan, a descendant of Robert J.
      Harlan, and retired professor Louis Harlan, who descends from John
      Marshall Harlan, gave blood samples for DNA testing. Test results showed
      it was unlikely the men were related, but the question remains: who was
      the father of Robert J. Harlan?

    </p>
    <p>
      One hundred years ago Robert Todd and Mary (Harlan) Lincoln moved into
      their new summer home &#147;Hildene&#148; at Manchester, Vermont. This
      July Hildene published the new book,
      <i>Four Marys and a Jessie: The Story of the Lincoln Women</i>, by C. J.
      King. The story of the Lincolns is also a Harlan Story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Harold Holzer, the author or editor of 23 books about Abraham Lincoln,
      wrote the book&#146;s introduction. He observed, &#147;[T]he Lincoln women
      have been woefully ignored by most historians, and deserve their day in
      the sun ... Now, at long last, C. J. King has filled in many blanks with a
      history of the Lincoln &#150; and Todd [and Harlan] &#150; women across
      two centuries.&#148; He concluded, &#147;[T]hanks to this sympathetic but
      honest book, we can feel closer to the family than ever.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      That, from a noted Lincoln authority and co-chairman of the nation&#146;s
      Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission. How could I improve on that?
      After all, I&#146;m only the author&#146;s father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The five women? The President&#146;s wife is the first: Mary Todd Lincoln.
      Another is Mary Eunice Harlan who married Robert Todd Lincoln three years
      after the president&#146;s assassination and was caught up in conflicting
      relationships with the former First Lady, her mother-in-law. Robert and
      Mary had two daughters, Mary and Jessie. And Jessie had a daughter named
      Mary Lincoln Beckwith. This fourth Mary, her brother Robert Todd Lincoln
      Beckwith and their cousin, Lincoln Isham, son of Jessie&#146;s sister,
      were all childless and were the last Lincoln descendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some readers will learn for the first time of the president&#146;s
      grandson, Abraham Lincoln II, whose personality and potential ended
      tragically at the age of sixteen and a half years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader catches glimpses of James Harlan, a college president and U.S.
      Senator from Iowa. A fascinating story unfolds about his wife, Ann Eliza,
      who stood up to a general to rescue wounded Iowa soldiers after the battle
      of Shiloh. This and other examples of care-giving changed the lot of
      countless wounded Union soldiers from many states. In unprecedented ways
      she was charting a new course in wartime health care.
    </p>
    <p>Speaking of glimpses, the book uses 35 photos to help tell the story.</p>
    <p>
      What motivated these women to challenge society&#146;s definition of the
      &#147;place&#148; of women? How did these family members determine that
      the &#147;role&#148; people expected of the Lincoln family was not for
      them? As a history major and husband of a Harlan, I enjoyed it and found a
      lot of food for thought in C. J.&#146;s book.

      Note: David Harlan, New Orleans, and his brother, from Jefferson Parish,
      were able to leave the area before Hurricane Katrina made landfall. They
      are staying with relatives in Mississippi. David&#146;s apartment is on
      the second floor, and he is hoping his copy of Alpheus Harlan&#146;s book
      and other records are safe. He sends his best to all who have been
      affected by Katrina.

      David&#146;s line is: George #3, James #11, John #44, Isaac #207, Isaac
      #797, Washington #2717, William #6802, Alonzo #6802(vi), Alonzo Grady
      (1899-1980), and his father, Robert Lloyd Harlan.

      <b><a name="world"></a>World Families Network Supports Surname Testing</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry Barton, of Marietta, Georgia, is a Harlan descendant through
      William-James-George-Aaron-Aaron-Aaron-Joseph-Alpheus-Mary Jane, who
      married Joseph James Barton. Mary Jane Harlan and Joseph Barton are
      Terry&#146;s great-grandparents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terry operates the World Families Network, a Web site dedicated to
      supporting Surname DNA testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, after significant success with his Barton DNA Project, he
      started two more family surname projects, and he writes that he has
      &#147;had such fun in working with cousins that I have decided to start a
      family project for many of my ancestral lines.&#148;<br />
      The Harlan Family Project is located at:
      <a href="http://www.world%20families.net/surnames/h/harlan"
        >http://www.world families.net/surnames/h/harlan</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      He adds that it has been exciting to learn which researchers are working
      on the same family (or branches) and seeing the information they have to
      share. He cites his Weisinger and Hodges Web sites as good examples of
      this&#151;links are listed below. &#147;This may be the place where the
      Harlan Family Project can serve the Harlan Family in America. I hope that
      you will agree that this is a useful addition to your work,&#148; he
      writes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.worldfamilies.net/surnames/h/hodges/patriarchs.html"
        >http://www.worldfamilies.net/surnames/h/hodges/patriarchs.html </a
      ><a
        href="http://www.worldfamilies.net/surnames/w/weisinger/patriarchs.html"

      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The second aspect of his Harlan Family Project may or may not be of
      interest. For surname families with a well-defined paper trail, such as
      the Harlan family in America, there is usually not much interest in
      surname testing, as they &#147;already know who they are.&#148; Some may
      secretly fear a past &#147;non-paternity&#148; event might be exposed. If
      there is any interest &#147;in establishing the DNA profile of our
      earliest Harlan ancestors, we should keep the actual participants
      confidential until the results are known,&#148; he writes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably, the ones interested in surname testing will be those that
      Alpheus Harlan didn&#146;t connect into the original family tree but who
      have long believed that they are part of our family, or those with other
      spellings trying to find more about their heritage. Terry is seeing that
      with other families.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, Family Surname DNA projects recognize that various spellings
      of a name may share a genetic heritage. Whether this will be the case with
      the Harlans or not, Terry has initially included other spellings in case
      there is interest.<br />
      &#147;For surnames without a well-defined paper trail, there is often
      significant interest in DNA testing to determine how to genetically link
      families,&#148; Terry writes. &#147;I can also offer another site to the
      Harlan family. The Joseph James Barton and Mary Jane Harlan home
      (&#147;The Barton House&#148;) is the centerpiece of the National Ranching
      Heritage Center in Lubbock, Texas.&#148;

    <p>
      Having just returned from a Harlan family reunion of my mother&#146;s
      immediate family, the article entitled Exploring Your Family History,
      published in the August 2005 issue of Better Homes and Gardens caught my
      eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article is about finding ways to &#147;tap those family roots.&#148;
      The Harlan Family is further ahead of many families whose roots in America
      preceded the Harlans&#146; arrival in 1687. We can certainly be proud of
      the fact that we are trying to keep that interest moving forward. With our
      national, regional and just plain old family reunions, we are preserving
      our ancestral heritage. Our newsletter, <i>The Harlan Record</i>, is a
      perfect example of recording Harlan history.
    </p>
    <p>
      The article points out that &#147;every family is a part of history, not
      only of the big events of their day but also those personal histories of
      triumphs and tragedies.&#148; My grandmother provided a wonderful record
      of her family&#146;s life by keeping copies of letters she wrote to her
      siblings in a letter that circulated among them several times a year. My
      sister was thoughtful enough to assemble the letters in a booklet format
      and gave one to each family unit at our recent reunion. It is a wonderful
      glimpse of not only family happenings but also local and national topics
      of importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letter writing is almost a lost art today since many use the telephone and
      the computer to communicate. All of these thoughts have led me to see the
      importance of making sure someone records today&#146;s family history for
      future generations. It would be so easy to sit back and hope someone does
      just that. Are you the one to record your family stories?
