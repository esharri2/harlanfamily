        Celebration 320 &#150; &#147;Discover Your Heritage,&#148; is the fourth
        national reunion of The Harlan Family in America in recent years. The
        2007 gathering will take place July 12-15 in Reno, Nev., and John
        Ascuaga&#146;s Nugget Hotel will be our headquarters.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Plans include tours to Donner Memorial Park and the silver mining town
        of Virginia City. You will learn about a wide variety of genealogy
        related topics as well as other interesting subjects.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        George Harlan (# 852) led a wagon train along the California Trail in
        1846. Through stories of his adventures you will learn about the
        pioneers moving west on the California and Oregon Trails.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        There will be a family picnic in a nearby park on Friday, a special
        dinner and program on Saturday evening, and a Sunday brunch, all with
        lots of time for visiting and renewing friendships. A hospitality room
        in the hotel will be a gathering place, and there will be various
        displays for viewing.
      </p>
      <p align="left">

        you know more about the reunion in the next newsletter. Meanwhile you

      <b><a name="Shakespeare"></a>Harlan-Shakespeare Connection?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea Campana, whose grandmother, Ella Harlan, was descended from George
      Harlan, noticed on page 955 of the Harlan genealogy book, under entry
      #8013, that one of Elizabeth C. Woodward's children, Joseph M. Gregg,
      married an Ella M. Shakespeare in 1893.
    </p>
    <p>
      Andrea wrote to the Harlan Record inquiring if anyone knows whether there
      is a connection between the Harlans and William Shakespeare.
      &#147;Wouldn&#146;t it be fun to learn that a Harlan ancestor had been
      married to a descendant of Shakespeare?!!!&#148; she wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did some preliminary research but didn&#146;t get very far. She went
      to the web site &lt;
      <a href="http://www.people-data.com">www.people-data.com</a> &gt; and
      found that Ella M. Shakespeare&#146;s closest &#147;living&#148; relative,
      Ralph S. Gregg, was listed as living in Wilmington, Del.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Andrea called the phone number and talked to his widow, who said Mr.
      Gregg had passed away two years ago at the age of 87. Mrs. Gregg said that
      no one in the family had ever researched whether the grandmother was
      related to Shakespeare. She had never heard of the Harlan family, and she
      didn&#146;t think her husband or son had either, so Andrea sent her the
      Harlan family web address and a brief genealogy. Mr. Gregg was descended
      from Michael.

        ><a name="they"></a>They Rode With J.E.B. Stuart&#146;s 1st Virginia
        Cavalry</b
      ><br />
      by Edward Harlan Wynn,<br />
      Harlan Record Contributing Editor<br />
      When the Confederate bugler sounded &#147;Boots and Saddles,&#148; four
      Harlan brothers answered his call. They were all members ofJ.E.B.
      Stuart&#146;s 1st Virginia Cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1st Virginia Cavalry was organized from prewar militia companies; the
      1st Virginia consisted initially of 12 companies (sometimes called
      &#147;troops&#148;), and completed organization July 16, 1861. One of the
      most famous Confederate cavalry regiments, the 1st Virginia was led by
      such intrepid leaders as J.E.B. Stuart, &#147;Fitz&#148; Lee, and
      &#147;Grumble&#148; Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 1st distinguished itself in several actions, including but not limited
      to, the Shenandoah Valley in 1861, at Bull Run, in Stuart&#146;s ride
      around McClellan, at Catlett&#146;s Station, Brandy Station, Kelly&#146;s
      Ford, Gettysburg, the Buckland &#147;Races,&#148; Todd&#146;s Tavern,
      Spotsylvania Court House, Yellow Tavern, Haw&#146;s Shop, Nance&#146;s
      Shop, Cold Harbor, Reams&#146; Station, Front Royal, Winchester,
      Waynesboro, Five Forks, and Appomattox Court House.
    </p>
    <p>
      The regiment fought in over 200 battles and skirmishes. From its ranks
      sprang such renowned cavalry leaders as John Singleton Mosby (nicknamed
      &#147;The Gray Ghost&#148;), Ridgely Brown and Gustavus W. Dorsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite heavy casualties, the 1st maintained its high morale and
      &eacute;lan to the bitter end. Escaping at Appomattox Court House, the
      regiment marched on to Lynchburg, Va., before disbanding April 11, 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Harlan brother to answer the Confederate call to arms was
      William Hunter Harlan (#2883). He was ninth of the 12 children of Jehu
      Harlan and Nancy Evans, of Berkeley County, Virginia (now West Virginia).
      At the time of his enlistment,<br />
      William was 22 years of age and described as 5' 10&quot; tall, with a fair
      complexion, light hair and gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      William enlisted as a Private in Company D, 2nd Virginia Infantry on May
      22, 1861. Later, (September 29, 1862) he joined his brothers in Company C,
      1st Virginia Cavalry, known as &#147;The Rockbridge Dragoons.&#148; He was
      wounded in the side on November 22, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the end of the war, the Union Army paroled him at Staunton, Va.,
      on May 29, 1865. He died November 18, 1923, at the age of 84 in Berkeley
      County, Va. He is buried in the Falling Waters Cemetery in Spring Mills,
      W.Va.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to join the Confederate cause were Silas Granville Harlan and George
      Boyd Harlan, both of whom enlisted on June 17, 1861, as privates in
      Company C, 1st Virginia Cavalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silas Harlan (#2875) was the oldest of the 12 children. He was a physician
      and had moved to Missouri in 1847, but he returned to his native state to
      serve in the 1st Virginia. He was married to Maria Rector from 1820 until
      1861. [Ed. Note: Maria died Jan. 11, 1861, five months before Silas&#146;
      enlistment.] He married Hannah Parsons in 1863, the year after his
      discharge from the Confederate Army.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service record of Silas reveals that on December 18, 1861, his horse
      died and was valued at $140. The Company Muster Roll from January-February
      1862 shows that he had had a horse in service since February 1, 1862.
      Silas was discharged from the Confederate Army on July 16, 1862, because
      he was overage (35 years old). He died in March 1877 at the age of 56, in
      Breckinridge, Stephens County, Texas, where he is buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      George Boyd Harlan (#2878), fourth of the 12 siblings, also served as a
      Private in Company C, 1st Virginia Cavalry. He enlisted with his older
      brother Silas. On October 26, 1861, he was given a six-day sick furlough
      to his home. On August 23, 1862, he was detailed as Quartermaster
      (Commissary) Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He last appeared on his unit&#146;s Muster Roll in July-August 1864. The
      next record of his name is an entry on a list of prisoners of war paroled
      by the Union Army at Winchester, Va., on April 28, 1865. At the time of
      his parole, George was described as 35 years of age, 5' 10&quot; tall,
      with a dark complexion, dark hair and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1867, he married Margaretta Keerl, with whom he had nine children.
      George died on September 6, 1899, at the age 70. The last of the Harlan
      brothers to join the 1st Virginia was Jehu Scott Harlan (#2886), the
      youngest of the 12 children, who enlisted as a Private on May 23, 1862, in
      Company F. At the time of his enlistment he was 16 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jehu was wounded in action on August 2, 1862, at Orange Court House. He
      transferred to Company E of the 1st Virginia Cavalry on February 8, 1863,
      at Culpepper Court House. On April 19, 1863, he joined his brothers in
      Company C of the 1st Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wounded in action a second time on May 9, 1864, at Spotsylvania
      Court House. He returned to duty and was wounded a third time on August
      25, 1864.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the end of the war, the Union Army paroled him at Staunton, Va.,
      on May 29, 1865. At the time of his parole he was described as being 19
      years of age, 5' 10&quot; tall, with a dark complexion, dark hair and dark
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On May 26, 1868, Jehu married Nannie Eskridge in Macon County, Mo., and
      died in Fairfax County, Va., on October 12, 1902, at age 56.
    </p>
    <p>
      In light of the combat history of their famous regiment, it is amazing
      that only two of the Harlan brothers were wounded and that all four
      survived the war and returned to civilian life.

        Reading the obituary of Harlan Cross Meredith, of Tuscaloosa, Ala.,
        makes it easy to be proud of the name Harlan. According to Tuscaloosa
        News Online, Harlan Meredith was &#147;known and appreciated as a man of
        high intelligence, great character, impeccable integrity, calm
        consistency and complete credibility.&#148;
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Born in Tuscaloosa in 1921, he was the son of Owen and Kate (Cross)
        Meredith. He graduated from Tuscaloosa High School in 1937 and from the
        University of Alabama&#146;s School of Commerce and Business
        Administration in 1941.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        After graduation, he went to work for his father&#146;s insurance
        company. But when World War II came, he applied for a direct commission
        with the Navy and was assigned to the Navy&#146;s hydrographic office in
        Chicago. While in Chicago, he lived in a local YMCA, an experience that
        planted the seed for future community service.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Meredith eventually transferred to the Pacific, where he participated in
        five major naval campaigns, including the Battle of Samar, where his
        task force helped defend Gen. MacArthur&#146;s beachhead on the
        Philippines from Japanese naval attack.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        After the war, Meredith was discharged with the rank of Lieutenant
        Commander. He returned to Tuscaloosa, married Mary Anne Norton, and
        resumed work at his father&#146;s business.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        He remained in the insurance business for next 53 years, first as a
        partner with his father&#146;s firm, and later with another agency.
        &#147;He earned a reputation for integrity that would follow him for the
        rest of his life,&#148; according to tuscaloosanews.com.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Meredith remained in the U.S. Naval Reserve, organized the first Naval
        Reserve unit in Tuscaloosa, and served as its commanding officer for
        three years.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        He was also active in business and civic organizations, president of the
        Insurance Agents of Tuscaloosa, the Alabama Association of Insurance
        Agents, and the Alabama Chapter of Chartered Property and Casualty
        Underwriters, and on the Board of Directors of the National Association
        of Insurance Agents.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        He was instrumental in the development of the Tuscaloosa YMCA and was
        president of the Tuscaloosa County YMCA. He served on the boards of the
        Tuscaloosa Chamber of Commerce, the United Fund of Tuscaloosa County,
        and the Southern Area Council of the National YMCA.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Meredith also played a key role in the creation of the Graduate School
        of Social Work at the University of Alabama in 1965. One year later, the
        National Association of Social Work honored him with the Ethel H. Wise
        award for this work, one of many awards he would receive during his
        life.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        He was honored as Tuscaloosa County Citizen of the Year in 1966. In
        2005, the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama inducted Meredith into the
        Tuscaloosa Civic Hall of Fame and gave him a Lifetime Achievement Award
        in recognition of exceptional business leadership. The Community
        Foundation of West Alabama named him a Pillar of the Community that same
        year.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;Few of his honors were more aptly named. This community was built
        on the strong shoulders of leaders like Harlan Meredith,&#148; according
        to tuscaloosa-news.com.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;He was always an example of what it means to be a leader,&#148;
        said the Rev. Charles Durham of First Presbyterian Church, where Harlan
        was a lifelong member and leader for many years. &#147;He was the most
        honest and upright ethical business person you&#146;ve ever seen.&#148;
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Harlan Meredith died on July 11 at the age of 85. A memorial service was
        held July 13, at the First Presbyterian Church in Tuscaloosa.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        He is survived by his wife; daughter Anne Meredith Meador and her
        husband Murray of Mobile; four grandchildren, Meredith Foster Horton of
        Daphne, J. Harlan Foster of Dallas, Caroline M. Meador of Birmingham and

      <p align="left">
        Dave is president of the Orange County Dualies Club, a motorcycle club
        formed in 1994 as an adventure club for sport enthusiasts in Southern
        California. Besides riding, the club gives back to the community,
        helping with trail work and raising money for the Pediatric Brain Tumor
        Foundation. They incorporated last year and received 501(c)(3) status.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        They have adopted trails in the San Bernardino Forest, located near Lake
        Arrowhead. And on May 20, 2006, they held the 2nd Annual Dualie Charity
        Ride, with all proceeds going to the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The club web site explains the connection: &#147;One year, the club
        decided to adopt a young boy with a brain tumor whose name was Michael
        Hoeflin. Sadly, Michael is not with us today and his subsequent loss to
        cancer had a profound impact on the Dualies. Since that time, the club
        has become more involved in charitable fundraising efforts for the
        Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation. Over the years, the Dualies have
        hosted multiple fundraisers and donated over $100,000 for charity.&#148;

      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Nina Harlan Kohl got involved in an effort to save trees in her
        neighborhood last fall, and in the process, she won the title of
        &#147;2005 Greenfield Superstar&#148; from the Greenfield (WI) Observer
        as a representative of her entire neighborhood and its involvement in a
        successful grassroots campaign.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        It started when she attended a neighborhood meeting to learn about
        proposed sewer, street and curbing improvements. Initially, the project
        didn&#146;t bother her. But a neighbor urged her to learn more, so she
        started attending city meetings and public hearings about the proposed
        changes.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;On Oct. 25, she heard that 123 trees were endangered as a result
        of the proposed widening of streets and from other road construction
        aspects, a figure that prompted a strong response,&#148; according to
        Greenfield Observer Staff Writer Stefanie Scott.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Kohl went home and immediately developed a web site called
        www.saveour123trees.org. It became &#147;the main communication tool for
        people looking for updates on the project and a vehicle for making their
        voices heard to city officials and local media,&#148; according to
        Scott.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        As a result of these and other efforts, the Greenfield Common Council
        decided not to widen most of the streets included in the neighborhood
        project and to install rolled curbs rather than straight-cut ones. Most
        of the trees were also saved in the process.<br />
        <br />
        Kohl told Scott that she hopes other Greenfield residents will see from
        this success that it pays to get involved in local government. &#147;She
        does not want people to view the situation as winning against City
        Hall,&#148; Scott wrote.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;Some people said, &#145;You fought City Hall and you
        won,&#146;&#148; Kohl told Scott. &#147;And that&#146;s really not how I
        look at it. My reading of it is like citizens and City Hall worked
        together and everybody won.&#148;

        <i>Submitted by Marjory Harlan Sgroi</i>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Several years ago, because of my interest in Frank Lloyd Wright
        architecture, I purchased a small book entitled Frank Lloyd
        Wright&#146;s Lost Buildings by Carla Lind. Imagine my surprise when I
        found that one of the first &#147;lost buildings&#148; was the Harlan
        House, built in Chicago for Dr. Allison Harlan.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        I ran for my History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family to see if I
        could find Dr. Harlan &#150; and there he was on page 882, as big as
        life. Recently, when visiting a local Wright site, I saw in their
        bookshop a larger book with the same title and found the lost Harlan
        House again with an even better write-up about the family and the house.
        I was able to reach the author through the Frank Lloyd Wright
        organization&#146;s pipeline and asked her for permission to reprint her
        article. She was very agreeable so following is the article reprinted
        with her permission.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;While working for Adler and Sullivan in 1888-93, Wright accepted
        commissions for seven private houses, which he designed after hours
        &#150; a violation of his employment contract. Despite his efforts to
        conceal these &#145;bootleg&#146; jobs by using the name of his
        architect friend Cecil Corwin to announce the commissions in the trade
        press, he was eventually discovered by Sullivan. This house for Allison
        Harlan, designed in 1891 and built in Sullivan&#146;s neighborhood in
        1892, led to Wright&#146;s departure from the side of his greatest
        teacher.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;During his years with Sullivan, Wright had become skilled in the
        geometric, nature-based ornament the master preferred and used it here
        in fret-sawn panels across the front of the house. The conventionalized
        tracery patterns on the balcony and in the entry hall were similar to
        the motifs Wright used on the balcony and stairhall in the Charnley
        house in Chicago, done the same year for a Sullivan client. This,
        combined with the design&#146;s geometric freshness, could easily have
        given away Wright&#146;s authorship. In 1956 Wright told Dr.
        Harlan&#146;s daughter that it was the &#145;first house built my own
        way.&#146;
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;Wright included other features that he developed further in his
        later Prairie Style houses. The low, hipped roof and broad, sheltering
        eaves, the indirect entrance and generous verandas, the casement
        windows, the spindled screens in the stairhall, and the simple geometric
        forms &#150; all were unusual for the time and marked Wright&#146;s
        determination to break away from convention. The two-story house had six
        bedrooms, several of which opened onto balconies.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        &#147;Dr. Harlan, a dentist, demanded several changes to Wright&#146;s
        plan. The fireplace was moved from the central hall into the open living
        room, which was then divided into two parts. In about 1904, Harlan
        traded houses with his neighbors, the Byrneses, who sold Wright&#146;s
        structure in 1912. Vacant for years, it became a neighborhood hangout.
        For a short time it was used as a nursing home and then fell into ruin.
        A fire [in 1963] caused enough damage to require its demolition.&#148;

        <a name="Irish"></a><b>The Irish Interlude Part IV: The Third Brother</b
        ><br />
        by John H. Harland
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      (Editor&#146;s Note: The last three issues of the Harlan Record have
      featured an edited version of a long article on the years that the
      &#147;original&#148; Harland brothers spent in Ireland. Based on extensive
      research done by one of our cousins, John H. Harland, of Kelowna British
      Columbia, this has included information about Quakerism and Irish history.
      Here is the final installment, which focuses on Thomas Harland, the eldest
      brother of George and Michael, and on later Irish history. The full,
      unedited version of John&#146;s interesting account can be accessed
      through the link, &#147;Irish Interlude&#148; on the Harlan web site.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Harland: Thomas Harland was the elder brother of George and
      Michael, and had come with them to Ireland from Durham. By 1687 Thomas was
      a married man of about 40 years of age, with a large and growing family.
      He had married Katherine Bullock on 7 Feb., 1680, in the Quaker manner at
      the &#147;house of Francis Robinson in the Parish of Segoe, County
      Armagh.&#148; His wife died in March 1690.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must have approved of the decision of his brothers to go to America in
      1687, and may have helped finance the venture, but he himself elected to
      stay in Ireland rather than go to the Delaware, and perhaps his reluctance
      to move was dictated by his family situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is uncertainty concerning his date of death. Quaker records at the
      Public Records Office in Northern Ireland [PRONI] list the burial of a
      Thomas Harland at Moyraverty Quaker Burial Ground (near Lurgan) in 1683,
      but this may have been a different Thomas Harland than our common
      ancestor, because other records, including Alpheus Harlan&#146;s book,
      show that Thomas Harland remarried after his first wife died, to Alice
      Foster, of Lisnegarvy, at Richard Boyes house, Ballinderry Meeting, County
      of Armagh, in 1702. They were the parents of two sons, James and Thomas,
      and a daughter, Abigail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quaker records are sometimes misleading when dealing with a marriage, etc.
      It is not always clear who were the prime-moves and who were just
      witnesses. There is also a 1723 reference to a Thomas Harland being given
      assistance by the Friends following a fire, &#147;he being too old to
      recoup alone,&#148; but there the trail goes cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      My own family believe we are descendants of Thomas, but there were other
      Harlands in the Lurgan area, and this claim, and hence our claim of
      connection to The Harlan Family in America, is beyond proof or disproof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Irish History: The Brothers left for America in 1687, and while
      Irish history subsequent to that date is of less significance to The
      Harlan Family in America, it is worth tying up some loose ends and
      summarizing what happened over the next years. Some of these events may
      have affected Thomas Harland, who stayed behind in Ireland.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1688, the English Parliament lost patience with the Catholic sympathies
      of King James II, and in what is known as the Glorious Revolution, they
      invited his son-in-law William, Prince of Orange, to assume the crown as
      William III.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1689, following the flight of James II to Ireland and his raising an
      army there, William III arrived with his own forces and went on to defeat
      the Jacobites in a series of engagements, of which the most celebrated was
      the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. At different times during the campaign,
      both opposing armies passed through Lurgan, seriously disrupting the
      affairs of the inhabitants, so from that point of view, the timing of the
      Brothers&#146; departure was impeccable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be underlined that although Ireland was the focus of Europe in
      those immediate years, the military battles there were mere skirmishes
      when viewed as part of a much wider conflict. The War of the League of
      Augsburg (1688-1697) pitted France against England and several other
      countries, and included many theaters of war. The fighting took place in
      many places around the world, including what is now Nova Scotia and New
      York State. It ended with the Peace of Rijswick in 1697, and a century of
      relative tranquility (by Irish standards) followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Discontent continued to simmer, eventually resulting in the Rebellion of
      the United Irishmen in 1798. This was an important event in Irish history,
      but one beyond the scope of our study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irish Interlude Summary: To summarize our story: George and Michael, who
      founded the Harlan dynasty in the United States, spent a few years in
      Ireland, and I have tried to cast some light on their reasons for leaving
      England, explaining their choice of location in Ireland, and then
      considering what drew them to America. In the process I have attempted to
      show how these peregrinations fitted in to the big picture and what was
      going on in the wider world in which they lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlands are to be found in the Lurgan area to this day, and I know that
      some members of the Harlan Family Association have had the opportunity to
      meet Jim Harland and his charming wife Lillian, who live in Lurgan. He is
      of particular interest, in that he must be a descendant of Thomas Harland,
      brother of George and Michael, since following a tradition going back over
      three hundred years, the family are still members of the Lurgan Quaker
      Meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan vs. Harland: In the matter of the presence or absence of the
      terminal &#145;d&#146;: I always imagined that the Brothers intentionally
      dropped this after going to America, perhaps after meeting Huguenots who
      used that spelling. However, in the 17th century, the orthography was not
      fixed, and reflecting the level of literacy at the time, in Irish records
      we find the name spelled both ways&#150;not to mention Harlen and Harlin.
    </p>

      Acknowledgments: This report could not have been put together without the
      kind assistance of several people. Dr. Robin Harland, my brother who lives
      in Belfast, drove us round the Lurgan area to get an idea of the location
      in which the Brothers lived. Among others who helped were Dr. John
      McCavitt, Dr. Eoin Magennis, Arthur G. Chapman, Prof. Gerry Stockman, and
      Sean McCartan.

    <p>
      Besides his book on the Flight of the Earls, Dr. McCavitt wrote the
      article on Sir Arthur Chichester in the recently published Oxford
      University Press Dictionary of National Biography. He was very generous
      with his time and expertise, and kept me straight on several important
      points.

      benefited from many visits to Cranbrook Art Academy. She is mostly
      self-taught though she took some formal art classes at a Boston school and
      Wayne State University. She had several one-woman art shows in the early
      1980s. After an interval that included marriage and the birth of a son,
      she returned to her love of painting and has produced stunning closeup
      images found in gardens and forests. Her work combines both realism and
      impressionism which Jeanne calls &#147;Sharp Focus Impressionism.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently she won honorable mention in oil painting for the Best of
      Michigan Artists and Artisans contest and has received a number of awards
      for her floral paintings. Professionally she uses the name
      &#147;Harlan.&#148;

      <b><a name="seeking"></a>Seeking a Volunteer</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      During an Indiana Harlan Family Reunion, Esther Harlan Wells volunteered
      to gather updated genealogy for the Harlan family. She asked the Harlan
      association to help get the word out, and we have had great success with
      this project. The gathering of new data and documentation by Esther is a
      continuing tribute to Alpheus Harlan who began his genealogy task in 1881.
      The efforts of both will greatly benefit future generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Esther has been updating the new information on a database using Family
      Tree Maker, and she has also provided a hard copy of the updated genealogy
      lines to Chester County Historical Society for safekeeping. We have also
      posted the updated lines and contributors&#146; names in the Harlan Record
      and on the Harlan web site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to health reasons, Esther is asking if anyone will volunteer to update
      the database as new genealogy information comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are interested in continuing this project, please contact Junior F.
      Harlan at: &lt; harlanjay@cox.net &gt; or<br />
