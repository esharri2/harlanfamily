<h1><a name="drgourmet"></a>Dr. Gourmet (Dr. Harlan) &amp; the Webmaster</h1>
<p><img src="/record/images/timharlanmd.jpg" alt="Timothy S. Harlan, M.D." width="166" height="250"  style="padding-right:4px;" align="left" />It is Dr. Tim Harlan&rsquo;s face that you will see at &lt; www.drgourmet.
	com &gt;, but this award-winning venture is more than a one-Harlan operation.
	Originally, the Dr. Gourmet trademark was the brainchild of two Harlan brothers,
	Tim and Bruce, and now another Harlan is involved as well.</p>
<p>A board-certified Internist who practices medicine in New Orleans, Tim started
	off as a teenager working in the restaurant business in Atlanta. He began as
	a dishwasher and worked his way up, learning to cook from many fine chefs. At
	age 18, he was managing his first restaurant, and at 22, he opened his own restaurant,
	a small country-French caf&eacute;, Le Petit Caf&eacute;, in Athens, Ga.</p>
<p>For the next three years, he enjoyed the challenge of creating menus, being
	a chef and teaching cooking classes. When he enrolled at Emory University in
	Atlanta, he was planning on a degree in hotel and restaurant management, but
	along the way, he changed his mind and decided to become a physician. He discovered
	his fascination with medicine by spending a lot of time around physicians while
	his former wife dealt with severe diabetes and the possibility of a kidney transplant.
	He decided that he was passionate enough about medicine to pursue it as a career.</p>
<p>He worked as a caterer while earning an undergraduate degree in biology and
	anthropology. He then went on to Emory University School of Medicine. While
	there, he noticed that medical providers concentrated on telling patients what
	not to eat, not on what they should eat and how to make it taste delicious.
	This inspired him to write his first book, <i>It&rsquo;s Heartly Fare</i>, a food manual
	for patients with cardiovascular disease (Pritchett &amp; Hull, 4th ed., 2005).</p>
<p>He has also published <i>Cooking to Reduce the Burn</i> (Tap Pharmaceutical, 2005)
	for those who suffer from gastric reflux disease, and Hand on Heart, with recipes
	from the Dr. Gourmet Web site, published by END-papers in 2004.</p>
<p>Dr. Tim spent 12 years as a &ldquo;country doctor,&rdquo; practicing in the
	small, rural town of Front Royal, Va., west of D.C. He saw patients with all
	kinds of complaints, and it seemed like the most common cause was a poor diet.
	Over time, his interest in good food evolved into a concern over public health.</p>
<p>His Web site, &lt;  www. drgourmet. com &gt;, features a basic good-health
	diet planner called the &ldquo;eatTHISdiet,&rdquo; which is a delicious way
	to eat healthy, lose weight, or take care of conditions like lactose intolerance,
	gastric reflux, or diabetes; to reduce sodium, cholesterol, and fat, or to eat
	right if you&rsquo;re taking Coumadin (generic name: warfarin). The Web site
	also offers reviews of fast food and convenience foods, nutritional newsletters,
	guest columnists, a recipe of the week, and more.</p>
<p>Dr. Gourmet&reg; is a natural outgrowth of Dr. Harlan&rsquo;s interest in
	good food and good health: &ldquo;Eating well and eating healthy is the same
	thing,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Tim and his brother, a television producer, developed The Dr. Gourmet Show,
	filming it at Bruce&rsquo;s studios in Atlanta to air on public television in
	Atlanta and the Southeast. In 2002, The Dr. Gourmet Show won an Emmy&reg; award.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Harlan has also been an on-air consultant to the TV Food Network show
	Cooking Thin and has hosted the DIY network show, AskDIY.</p>
<p>Morgan Ladd Harlan, Tim&rsquo;s wife, is Webmaster for the Dr. Gourmet Web
	site. As such, she creates the actual pages you see when you visit the Web site.
	Each time you click on a link, you are taken to a new &ldquo;page.&rdquo; Each
	page is actually a separate file that is stored on the host computer, the &ldquo;server.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She recently agreed to take over as the new Webmaster for the Harlan Family
	in America Web site &lt; www.harlanfamily.org &gt;, a job that Pam Ellingson
	has been doing since the Web site was first created after the 1997 Iowa reunion.
	Jonathan Harlan, of Tennessee, founded the Web site, and he has allowed his
	company&rsquo;s computer to be used as the server, where all of the Harlan Web
	site-page files are stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan grew up in Los Angeles. She has been a Web designer since 1995, and
	in 2000, she moved to Washington, D.C., to manage the Web site for Trinity College.
	A year later, she was hired by the Association of American Medical Colleges
	as a Web developer, where she specialized in information architecture. She met
	Tim while working there, and they moved to New Orleans in January 2007, soon
	after they were married.</p>
<p>They met, appropriately enough, by online dating. Morgan said she was very
	careful to post a profile asking questions in such a way that she could gauge
	the respondent&rsquo;s age and personality from the way he answered. She said
	their first date was &ldquo;terrible&rdquo; because Tim asked so many questions
	she felt like a patient being grilled by her doctor! But she decided to give
	it another chance, and after that things went much better!</p>
<p>Tim was offered a job at the Tulane University Medical School, Morgan&rsquo;s
	alma mater, so they decided to move to New Orleans. It was the first place they
	traveled to together, and they spent their honeymoon there. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
	a fantastic place to live, and to be here and be part of the renaissance of
	the city at this time is very special,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Both Tim and Morgan enjoyed learning about the Harlan heritage at Celebration
	300 and at the Reno reunion. Tim also accompanied his mother, Katherine Bartlett
	Harlan, on the last Harlan Family heritage trip to England in 2003. His sister,
	Katherine Mignon Harlan, of Downingtown, Pa., recently joined the Harlan Family
	board. Tim and Katherine have two other siblings, Bruce and Ralph. They haven&rsquo;t
	worked out their whole Harlan line yet, but their father&rsquo;s family is from
	central Pennsylvania, and Katherine M. says that finding the missing links is
	a project on her list for retirement.</p>

<p>When Elisha Harlan (#2995) died in 1919, his obituary in the local newspaper
	proclaimed &ldquo;Pioneer of 1846 Crosses Divide.&rdquo; He was 80 years old,
	and there was a lot to report about his life which began on August 5, 1838,
	in Berrien County, Mich.</p>
<p>Descended from a long line of farmers, his father, George Harlan (#852), had
	moved to Michigan from Indiana. George owned considerable acreage and was apparently
	a successful farmer when he sold everything and headed for California with his
	extended family and a large herd of cattle in 1845. After wintering in Lexington,
	Mo., the party continued on to California, arriving in 1846. The details of
	this epic journey are well-told by my cousin, William K. Harlan, in &ldquo;The
	Great Trek,&rdquo; available at the Harlan Family Web site and included in the
	newly-reprinted autobiography of Jacob Harlan, California 1846-1888, available
	from Squire Cheyney Books, P.O. Box 439, Downingtown, PA 19335. (Repacked book
	is entitled Eyewitness to the Settlement of the West: Jacob Wright Harlan&rsquo;s
	California 1846-1888.)</p>
<p>Elisha was a boy of 8 when he arrived in California in 1846. His mother, Elizabeth
	Duncan, died that fall at Mission Santa Clara. His father, George, died at Mission
	San Jose in 1850. At only 12 years old, Elisha was an orphan in this distant
	land that had recently been under Mexican rule. But he had a large extended
	family scattered around the San Francisco Bay. Young Elisha lived at various
	locations in California including Mission San Jose, San Francisco, Napa Valley
	near Calistoga, Coloma in the Sierras after gold was discovered in 1848, and
	finally San Ramon in Contra Costa County, where his older brother Joel (#2992)
	had a large ranch.</p>
<p>In 1860 he went over the Coast Mountains into the San Joaquin Valley where
	he bought land near Kingston on the lower Kings River. There he engaged in livestock
	buying and selling. In 1869 he moved to the vicinity of Riverdale in Fresno
	County where he homesteaded 160 acres. The area was then known as Liberty.</p>
<p>Elisha married Margaret Bonnard in 1867, but she died before the end of the
	year. Then on September 14, 1871, in San Luis Obispo, Calif., Elisha married
	Lucy I. Hobaugh, a native of Indiana. They had five children. The first, Nellie
	(#7444), died an infant. Jerome (#7445) lived on, and ranched, part of Elisha&rsquo;s
	land where one of his descendants, Brad Harlan, still lives and farms. Irene
	(#7446) was active in ranching also. Leroy (#7447) lived on, and ranched, part
	of Elisha&rsquo;s land and one of his descendants, Robert Harlan, still lives
	on the property. Aleda (#7448) married a minister and moved around California.</p>
<p>From about 1883-1901, the Harlan family had the Liberty post office in their
	living room. Lucy Harlan was the postmistress for the small agricultural community.
	The mail must have brought many neighbors to their home just northeast of Riverdale,
	where the post office was relocated in 1901.</p>
<p>After homesteading 160 acres in 1869, Elisha continued to buy land in Fresno,
	Kings and Monterey counties until he had about 3,000 acres. At his ranch in
	Riverdale he had both dairy cows and beef cattle that were driven to his extensive
	rangeland in the Coast Mountains each summer for pasturage.</p>
<p>When Elisha finally retired from ranching, he and Lucy moved to a house near
	Laton just east of Riverdale. The ranch was divided among their four children.
	I was born and raised in Fresno and have very fond memories of going to my grandfather
	Leroy&rsquo;s house. We played in the surrounding fields, soaked in irrigation
	ditches and rode horses.</p>
<p>I recall peering into the dark old barn that was part of the original homestead
	and still offered some protection for dusty old wagons and buggies.</p>
<p>When Elisha Harlan died on February 27, 1919, he was remembered as &ldquo;one
	of Riverdale&rsquo;s oldest and most respected citizens.&rdquo; He and his wife,
	as well as several of their children and grandchildren, are buried in the Washington
	Colony Cemetery located in Easton between Riverdale and Fresno.</p>
<h2><a name="performer"></a>A Harlan Performer from the Past</h2>
<p>A native of Zanesville, Ohio, actor Otis Harlan (#9495) will forever be remembered
	as the voice of &ldquo;Happy,&rdquo; the lovable character in Walt Disney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Snow
	White and the Seven Dwarfs,&rdquo; filmed in 1937.</p>
<p>Otis was born in 1865 and grew up to be a roly-poly comedian and actor. For
	years he played vaudeville and later acted on Broadway and in numerous films,
	including animated movies. He performed in &ldquo;Alexander's Ragtime Band,&rdquo; a
	1911 vaudeville show by Irving Berlin.</p>
<p>According to Alpheus Harlan&rsquo;s genealogy book, he married Nellie Hallett
	at Camden, N.J., on November 4, 1902, and they had one daughter, Marion Louise,
	born June 8, 1904. The book gives Otis&rsquo; date of birth as 1864, but other
	biographies list the year as 1865.</p>
<p>Otis&rsquo; Harlan lineage is: George #3, Ezekiel #5, William #22, George
	#116, Ezekiel #470, Ezekiel Jefferson #1693, and William S. #4676.</p>
<p>Apparently, Otis tried to retire in 1914, but he couldn&rsquo;t stay away
	from acting. A 1914 New York Times news story reported that he had signed
	up for a role in the upcoming &ldquo;Apartment 12-K.&rdquo; What happened next
	is not certain, but the show was short-lived, and recent movie history databases
	list another actor in that role. Still, his acting career continued until
	at least 1938. He died of a stroke in 1940 at the age of 74. For more information
	and pictures, visit: &lt; www.fandango.com &gt; 
	&lt; www.imdb.com &gt;, or  &lt; http://movies.nytimes.com &gt;</p>
<h2><a name="nephew"></a>Nephew of Otis Harlan Was Handsome Actor</h2>
<p>Kenneth D. Harlan was a handsome stage actor in New York during the early
	1900s. In 1916, he moved to Hollywood and appeared in dozens of silent movies
	and later, sound movies.</p>
<p>With his good looks and talent, he was tapped for roles in dramas, comedies
	and western movies. He states that his inspiration came from his mother, an
	actress, and as a youth, he spent much time in the wings of theaters where she
	performed. As a student, he not only had lead parts in plays but also designed
	sets and costumes and coached other actors.</p>
<p>Kenneth was born in Boston, Mass., in 1895 and attended St. Francis College
	and Fordham University in New York. He married a total of seven times, including
	a marriage to Marie Prevost, silent screen star. He retired in 1943 but reappeared
	in 1966 in small roles for television movies. He died in 1967 in Sacramento,
	Calif.</p>
<p>The Web site: &lt; www.goldensilents.com &gt; contains a list of Kenneth Harlan&rsquo;s
	movies as well as photographs of the handsome actor.</p>

<p>Deep in the heart of Missouri, three generations of the Burger family have,
	for the past 80-plus years, been producing country cured hams on the family
	farm. Burgers&rsquo; Smokehouse is now the nation&rsquo;s largest producer of
	country ham and smoked meats, and is the mail order leader in cured and hickory
	smoked meats.</p>
<p>Current management of the multimillion dollar family-owned company includes
	third-generation Steven and Philip Burger, the sons of Morris and Dolores Harlan
	Burger. Morris led the business from 1959 to 2000. The company was founded by
	Morris&rsquo;s father, E. M. Burger, who cured his first ham for resale in 1927.</p>
<p>Dolores served the company as secretary to the president and corporate secretary
	for over 25 years. Semi-retired, she is now working on the company archives.
	In addition to their two sons, the Burgers have one daughter, Sara Beth Rohrbach,
	and eight grandsons.</p>
<p>Burgers&rsquo; Smokehouse cures more than 750,000 hams annually, with the
	entire curing process taking four to six months. The hams are seasoned and hand-rubbed,
	aged and smoked, then trimmed, sliced and packaged using the latest technology
	in the processing of the meats. In addition to its mail-order business, Burgers&rsquo; provides
	meat products to many national restaurants including Cracker Barrel, Waffle
	House, and Bob Evans, and their meats are available in retail stores across
	the country.</p>
<p>What began as a small family business now employs several hundred workers,
	and their plant has been enlarged several times over the years. In addition
	to their famous country cured hams, they sell a number of other meats, including
	Cornish hen, turkey, quail, pheasant, bacon, beef roasts, tenderloin, pork
	chops, and other epicurean specialties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burgers&rsquo; Smokehouse was included in the History Channel&rsquo;s Modern
	Marvels episode called &ldquo;The Pig,&rdquo; which aired in November and continues
	to be shown from time to time. Recent articles featuring Burgers&rsquo; have
	been published in Rural Missouri (November 2007) and other regional publications,
	and a feature article about the Smokehouse was written by Brook Harlan of Columbia,
	Mo., for Inside Columbia.</p>
<p>In 2007 Burgers&rsquo; Smokehouse was voted Best AgriMissouri product in a
	survey conducted by Rural Missouri, a monthly magazine published by Missouri
	Electric Cooperatives. The company has also been featured on NBC&rsquo;s &ldquo;Today
	Show&rdquo; and in Better Homes and Gardens magazine.</p>
<p>Visitors to Burgers&rsquo; plant, just south of California, Mo., may enter
	the Visitors&rsquo; Center through a replica of a covered bridge, and then enjoy
	looking at the large and impressive dioramas, which represent the four seasons
	of the year, before concluding their tour in the meat store and snack bar.</p>
<p>Dolores has served on the Alumni and Foundation Boards of the University of
	Central Missouri, with emeritus status in both. Among other volunteer activities,
	she is a director on the boards of the California (Mo.) Chamber of Commerce
	and Missouri KidsFirst, a program dealing with the prevention of child abuse
	in Missouri; she also serves her church as an adult Sunday school teacher and
	member of the Pastor/Parish committee.</p>
<p>Dolores is a descendant of George Harlan (#3) in the History and Genealogy
	of the Harlan Family, great-granddaughter of George Alexander Harlan (#7035),
	granddaughter of Wilber Gilbert Harlan, and daughter of Byron Morris Harlan.
	She is a first cousin, once removed, of Lane and Ridge Harlan, who were instrumental
	in the organization of The Harlan Family in America association.</p>
<p>Dolores and Morris have attended all four of the recent national Harlan Reunions,
	and she served as co-chairman of the Hospitality/Registration committee for
	Celebration 310 in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, in 1997.</p>

<h2> <a name="additions"></a>Additions to the Harlan Bookshelf</h2>
<p><b>Wild West Books<br />
</b>	by Byrl Harlan</p>
<p>Byrl Harlan, of Brownsburg, Ind., has found his muse. Last year, he published
	two books and had an excerpt of one of these published in an anthology of Indiana
	writers. This year, a third novel is scheduled for publication.</p>
<p>Hidden Creek Ranch, published by Xlibris in 2007, is a modern-day western.
	The main character, Will Davis, rides the Interstates as well as bucking broncos,
	traveling to compete in the rodeo circuit. The book is a mix of Old West elements,
	Christian values, and the pains and pleasures of life.</p>
<p>Byrl&rsquo;s second book, The Arrival of Tom and Jenny, also published by
	Xlibris, has a western setting as well. It&rsquo;s a children&rsquo;s picture
	book about two cats who arrive at a ranch and are befriended by the ranch hands.</p>
<p>These two books are available from the author:</p>
<p>&lt; www.byrlharlanbooks.com &gt;  or &lt; bdharlan@comcast.net&gt;&nbsp;	or from &lt; www.xlibris.com &gt;.</p>
<p>Xlibris is a print-on-demand, self-publishing service affiliated with Random
	House.</p>
<p>An excerpt of Hidden Ranch was chosen from hundreds of submissions for inclusion
	in Indiana Authors 2007, a three-book anthology published by the Indiana Authors
	Bookstore, 36 E. Maryland St., Indianapolis, IN, 46204, phone 317-633-4070.</p>
<p>Byrl was trained by the U.S. Air Force as an air traffic controller and spent
	24 years in that career, working in the U.S., Japan, Korea and Saudi Arabia.
	He began writing a few years ago and hasn&rsquo;t stopped since! He and his
	wife Dolores have two children, Stephen and Clarissa.</p>
<h3><b><a name="tales"></a>Tales from the Ozarks</b></h3>
<p>The Spring 2007 issue of the Harlan Record included a story about Chris and
	Missy Harlin and their Old Harlin House Caf&eacute;, in Gainesville, Mo. Chris&rsquo;s
	grandfather, Hugh Tan Harlin, published a book in 1996 that traces the lives
	of the Harlins of Ozark County, Mo. Titled The Harlins of Ozark County, the
	book is now available from Chris&rsquo;s father, John Layton Harlin (P.O. Box
	68, Gainesville, MO 65655).</p>
<p>The book begins with Hugh Tan Harlin&rsquo;s grandparents, who migrated to
	Missouri from Monroe County, Kentucky, in 1869. After settling in Gainesville,
	the Harlins started the town&rsquo;s first bank, now called Century Bank of
	the Ozarks, and several generations of the family were bankers. This memoir
	also includes reminiscences of small town life throughout the 20th century.</p>
<p>Hugh Tan Harlin&rsquo;s first cousin wrote a different kind of memoir about
	life in this Ozark community. Amos Harlin&rsquo;s book, For Here is My Fortune,
	is a fictionalized account that attempts to correct false impressions.</p>
<p>Amos was inspired to write by the negative reactions he used to get when he
	told people where he was from. He wrote that, &ldquo;In time I learned that
	this amazement had its inception not as I first supposed, because I had enjoyed
	the unique privilege of growing up in that lovely land, but from their inability
	to conceive of anyone so lacking in pride as to openly admit having spring from
	the strange denizens of that dark country.&rdquo; His literary effort celebrates
	the character of the Ozarks people. John Harlin also has copies of this book,
	originally published in 1946 by a division of McGraw-Hill.</p>
<h2>Alpheus Harlan&rsquo;s Genealogy Book</h2>

	the Harlan Family, is available by ordering from:</p>

<h2><a name="ninety"></a>Addition to the 90 Plus Club</h2>
<p>Leah Corrine Harlan Kenworthy of Fountain City, Ind., was born May 26, 1917,
	in Randolph Co., Ind. She is the daughter of Russell and Goldie McFarland Harlan.</p>
<p> Her Harlan line is: George (#3), Aaron (#8), Aaron (#41), James (#199), Valentine
	(#736), Joshua (#2489), Valentine (#6249) Russell (#6249.7).</p>
<h2><a name="four"></a>A Four-Legged Harlan</h2>
<p>Harlan, an American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) stallion, was foaled
	in 1951 to Paul and Jack Smith of Indiahoma, Okla. He was named for Harlan Beetch,
	to whom the Smiths had loaned the foal&rsquo;s stallion for breeding purposes.</p>
<p>In 1954, Harlan was purchased by Bob and Joan Robey of Edmond, Okla. When
	they first saw him, he was a shaggy colt who at feeding time, finished his grain
	and then went stall-to-stall and finished the grain of the other horses. This
	fits right in with the human Harlan trait of loving to eat!</p>
<p>Bob Robey trained Harlan for calf roping. He had tremendous speed and a great
	stop. His greatest success came as a breeding stallion. His foals performed
	in reining and cutting competition and the show arena. Seventeen of his foals
	were AQHA Champions, one a World Champion, and 51 earned Register of Merit for
	superior performance. Harlan is still listed as one of the all-time leading
	sires of AQHA Champions. He died in 1973 and was buried on the Robey ranch.</p>

<h2><a name="unexpected"></a>Unexpected Encounter</h2>
<p> By Judy Knight, Cuba, Mo.</p>
<p>The saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Small World,&rdquo; seems to take on new meaning
	when you&rsquo;re a Harlan descendant. Since discovering my Harlan heritage
	I&rsquo;ve found cousins in the most unexpected places.</p>
<p>My husband, Bob, is a Southern Baptist pastor. From 1982 until 2005 he pastored
	in a small rural town in northeast Missouri &mdash; a town called Eolia. One
	evening we were at an associational meeting and one of our pastor friends came
	to me after the meeting and said, &ldquo;Your shirt!&rdquo; I looked and saw
	that I was wearing a &ldquo;Harlan Family in America&rdquo; shirt. I asked what
	was wrong with my shirt and he replied, &ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong with it.
	My mom is a Harlan!&rdquo; He put me in contact with his mom, Linda Job, and
	we kept in touch for awhile. I have to admit that I have lost contact with her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought that was &ldquo;fun&rdquo; and told many people about it.</p>
<p>In 2005 we were called to the First Baptist Church, Cuba, Mo., and in July
	2006 I became the church secretary. &ldquo;Visitor cards&rdquo; come across
	my desk most Monday mornings. A few months ago the cards of two visiting couples
	were turned in &mdash; the Stephens and their friends, the Harlans!</p>
<p>The next Sunday morning the couples were back, so before the service began,
	I went over and introduced myself and asked, &ldquo;Which of you are the Harlans?&rdquo; Paul
	and Sue immediately spoke up. I explained that I was also a Harlan. Paul brought
	me a copy of his &ldquo;family tree,&rdquo; and I have compared it to mine.
	We have to go all the way back to 1687 and George to find our common ancestor
	because when George had children, we branch off &mdash; Paul is a descendant
	of James, and I&rsquo;m a descendant of Ezekiel &mdash; but that&rsquo;s okay.
	We&rsquo;re still &ldquo;family,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s great.</p>

<h2><a name="gives"></a>Harlan Family Gives to Harlan-Lincoln House</h2>
<p>At the 2007 national Harlan reunion in Reno, one of the beneficiaries chosen
	for financial support was the Harlan-Lincoln House in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. A
	donation was made in honor of the late Ridge Harlan, coordinator of the 1997
	Harlan reunion held in Mt. Pleasant.</p>
<p>Two projects were selected for the Harlan support&mdash;the restoration of
	the Lincoln pump organ, and the preservation and reframing of a lithograph of
	the Andersonville Civil War prisoner of war camp.</p>
<p>Mary Harlan Lincoln and her daughter, Jessie Lincoln Beckwith, both used the
	organ, and it was later donated to the Christian Science Church in Mt. Pleasant.
	The organ was then privately owned before being donated to the Harlan-Lincoln
	House.</p>
<p> The State Historical Society of Iowa will undertake the conservation of the
	lithograph, and it will then be framed, using museum quality materials.</p>
<p>The Harlan Family in America has supported the Harlan-Lincoln House for several
	years and is a charter member of Friends of the Harlan-Lincoln House. Individual
	members of the Harlan Family also support the Harlan-Lincoln House restoration
	efforts. For more information, call Harlan-Lincoln House Executive Director
	Lynn Ellsworth, 319-385-6320.</p>
<h2><a name="hallows"></a>All Hallows Church, England, Sends Thanks</h2>
<p>A letter from Derek Jacobs, Chairman of the All Hallows Trust Fund, sent a
	letter of appreciation for the $1,000 contribution towards the restoration of
	Harlan memorials in the church. All Hallows is located in Sutton on the Forest
	in England.</p>
<p> Several memorials at the church have been declared &ldquo;perilous&rdquo; by
	the church architect and have had to be &ldquo;strapped securely to the church
	walls, covered by plastic foam and boxed in. These steps are for safety reasons
	only, pending urgent repairs,&rdquo; according to Mr. Jacobs.</p>
<p>The All Hallows Church has been visited by many Harlan travelers. A trust
	fund was established four years ago so anyone interested in maintaining the
	church can contribute to the maintenance and repair of the historic structure
	which contains many Harlan memorials. For more information, e-mail Derek Jacobs
	at &lt; djj3@btinternet.com &gt;.</p>
<h2><a name="donation"></a>Jacob Wright Harlan Book Donation</h2>

	of Utah. A letter of appreciation from the Society has been received by the
	Harlan Family.</p>

	trip West, at times with the Donner Party. He tells of the gold rush, settlement
	and life in California. Other Harlan historical articles are included in the

<p>Kim Harlan, of Great Falls, Mont., has a last will for Kitte Summers and other

	Litchfield, Ill., near her twin sister Mattie Keating. The documents belonged
	to Kim&rsquo;s grandfather, Keith Cameron Harlan, and they also list his two
	brothers and two sisters, along with others. Kim has not heard of Kitte before
