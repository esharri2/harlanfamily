            >Editor�s Note: Ed Danson is a land and geodetic surveyor in England
            and author of a recently published book about the exploits of
            Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon. In it, he gives an account of

          <p>
            The&nbsp; Mason-Dixon line has always been at&nbsp; the center of
            controversy, even before it became known as the dividing line
            between North and South. Starting in November 1763, British
            astronomer Charles Mason (1728-1786) and his colleague and friend,
            Jeremiah Dixon (1733-1779), land surveyor and amateur astronomer
            from County Durham, England, spent nearly five years gazing at
            stars, plotting points, traveling, and erecting mile markers to mark
            this boundary, and thus settle a bitter border dispute between
            Maryland and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Fifteen miles north of this line, on a farm owned by John Harlan,
            they set up the Stargazer Stone and their headquarters. Ed Danson
            writes:&nbsp; �They arrived at John Harlan�s plantation on Sunday,
            January 8, 1764. The first task was to observe the latitude with
            their zenith sector (an eight-foot tall telescope) in a tent in the
            backyard. Meanwhile, some laborers began building a small
            wooden&nbsp; observatory&nbsp; to house the zenith sector, a transit
            and equal altitude instrument (now on display in Independence Park)
            and a pendulum clock (like a grandfather clock), called an
            astronomical regulator. The latitude was found to be a fraction
            south of Cedar Street [Philadelphia] and the monument that marked
            the spot became known as the Stargazer�s Stone (see note 1).&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            �The winter weather turned bad and while Mason and Dixon waited for
            it to improve, they entertained the family with tales of their
            travels to Africa. On March 17 there was an eclipse of the moon,
            which Mason let the family see through his brass reflecting
            telescope.�&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            On Monday, April 2, 1764, Mason and Dixon set off to take
            measurements southward. That winter, they returned to spend
            Christmas with the Harlans.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            In the spring, they worked as far west as the Susquehanna River. By
            fall, they had reached North Mountain. When winter set in, Mason
            returned alone to spend time with the Harlans while Dixon went to
            Philadelphia. Six weeks later Mason was off traveling too.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            In the spring of 1766, Mason and Dixon continued work on the West
            Line. Danson writes, �They reached Savage Mountain, the limit of the
            Royal Proclamation, by June and could go no further without&nbsp;
            permission from the Six Nation Indians.� From there, they went to
            Newark, where they learned that the Royal Society would fund the
            very first measurement of a Degree of Latitude in America. Unable to
            continue on the West Line until the Indians gave their consent, they
            worked on the Degree until October, then left to complete their
            survey eastward to the Delaware.&nbsp;

            <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

          <br /><a name="continue"></a>�In November, 1766, Mason and Dixon
          returned to the Harlan plantation to conduct more scientific
          observations alongside the Stargazer�s Stone and to determine the
          strength of gravity. They used two pendulum clocks; one of these was
          the Royal Society�s famous regulator made by John Shelton that had
          been used on St. Helena, at the Cape of Good Hope and even in
          Barbados, where it was used in testing the world�s first chronometer,�
          Danson writes.&nbsp;

          <p>
            �There were walnut trees in the garden, and a well-seasoned piece
            was used as a pendulum. Harlan�s back yard was added to the growing
            collection of information that helped to determine the size of the
            Earth.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            �Christmas and New Year, 1767, were spent at the farm; the air
            temperature was 22&deg;F below freezing, so cold that using the
            instruments was �like patting one�s Fingers against the points of
            Pins and Needles.� On February 16, they determined the longitude of
            the Stargazer�s Stone, making it (at the time) the most accurately
            known point in the Americas.�&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            In June, they learned that the Six Nations had agreed to allow the
            boundary survey to continue westward. �The last phase began on July
            7 and all went well until the Monongahela, where half the men
            deserted, they were so terrified of Indian attack. Indian bands
            stalked the survey team and some even paid them a visit. At a
            warpath near Dunkard Creek, their Indian guides refused to go �one
            step further.� It was October 10, 1767, �near the 230th Mile Post�;
            today a monument marks the spot.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            �They returned to the Harlan plantation on December 9 to draw their
            beautiful map of the Mason-Dixon Line. Their last task was to
            complete the measurement of a Degree of Latitude. On February 22,
            1768, once more setting off from the Stargazer�s Stone, they
            measured all the way (and back) to the Delaware Middle Point, 95
            miles to the south.�&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            Mason and Dixon returned to England on September 11, 1768. They
            never again worked together. Dixon returned to County Durham where
            he died in 1779. Mason continued to work for the Greenwich
            Observatory until after the Revolutionary War, then returned to
            Philadelphia with his second wife, Mary, and eight children, but he
            was already ill. He died October 25, 1786, and was buried in Christ
            Church burying ground.

      <br />by Ed Wynn
    </p>

    <p>
      Jonathan T. Marshall (#3346), the grandson of Ann Harlan (#270), was tried
      by a Court Martial in October, 1863, for �embezzling� a horse. He was,
      however, found not guilty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jonathan was the second of twelve children of Hannah Travilla (#1047) and
      Samuel Marshall. He was born in Chester County, PA, on August 12, 1823. On
      February 24, 1848, he married Jane Peirce (#5056). Jan and Jonathan had
      two children: Lovetta, b. 1849, d.&nbsp; 1853; and Austin J. Marshall, b.
      1865, d. 1872.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jonathan�s military career began on October 25, 1861, when he enlisted as
      a 1st Lieutenant in the 110th Regiment of the Pennsylvania Volunteer
      Infantry. He was immediately assigned as Quartermaster for the Regiment
      via a Governor�s Certificate dated October 25, 1861. His age at the time
      of his enlistment is given as 36. The enlistment took place in
      Philadelphia and was for the duration of the war.
    </p>

    <p>
      At some point, not specified, in his army records, Jonathan was wounded in
      the foot and also sustained additional injuries when his horse fell on
      him. Beginning in mid-1862, his records are comprised primarily of sick
      leave and certificates from doctors relating to his physical problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      On October 7, 1863, he was court martialed before a General Court,
      presided over by Lt. Col. J. W. Greenzwalt of the 105th PA, convened at
      the Headquarters 1st Division, 3rd Corps, near Culpepper, VA. He was
      charged with misapplication and enbezzlement of public property entrusted
      to him, and of making false returns of Government property entrusted to
      him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the first charge, four specifications are recorded, that he
      embezzled �one horse owned by the United States� and applied it to his own
      use at the Camp of 110th P.V.I. near Falmouth, VA, around May 24, 1862;
      that he embezzled a horse owned by the army near Luray, VA, around June
      15, 1862; that he embezzled and appropriated �one gray mare the property
      of the United States by dropping said mare from his records, referring to
      it as a private horse,� near White Sulphur Springs, VA, around August 10,
      1863; and fourth, that �the said Jonathan T. Marshall, did take one horse
      the property of the United States found running astray by 1st Lieut.
      Charles Capelin, 111th P.V.I. and did not report said horse as public
      property with the intent thereby to defraud the United States Government
      of a horse. All this at Camp near White Sulphur Springs, VA, on or about
      10th day of August, 1863.�
    </p>

    <p>
      The second charge also contained a number of specifications, not detailed
      here in the interest of brevity. (Editor�s Note: Ed Wynn has a full copy
      of the Court Martial and will happily send it to anyone who has a special
      interest in reviewing the original document.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The Court found Jonathan not guilty of all charges and specifications.
      They stated: �The evidence is convincing to the receiving officers as to
      the fact that the charges against this officer emanated from personal ill
      feeling rather than a desire to promote the good of the service. Although
      the evidence discloses much looseness in the official business of the
      regiment, there was nothing produced to affect the character of the
      accused. Lt. Marshall will resume his sword.� Signed by command of Maj.
      General David Bell Birney, October 9, 1861.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jonathan resigned his commission and was given a medical discharge for
      �rheumatism� on December 12, 1863, approved by Major Gen. George G. Meade
      of Gettysburg fame.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a civilian, Jonathan was a hotel keeper. He died in Baltimore, MD, on
      June 5, 1870, just six months after the death of his wife, Jane. The cause
      of his death is listed as �Rheumatism�, contracted while he was in
      service. Both of their children had already died, so no direct descendants
      exist. Jonathan, Jane and their children are buried in the Oakland
      Cemetery near West Chester, PA.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i
        >A sad footnote: As late as 1895, Jonathan�s mother, Hannah, age 95, was
        still attempting to get a Mother�s Pension. Her application was
        rejected.</i

      <br />The Smiths were proud of their family tradition. Their ancestors had
      come to America on the Mayflower. They had included Senators and Wall
      Street wizards.
    </p>

    <p>
      They decided to compile a family history, a legacy for their children and
      grandchildren. They hired a fine author. Only one problem arose�how to
      handle that great-uncle George who was executed in the electric chair.
    </p>

    <p>The author said he could handle the story tactfully.</p>

    <p>
      The book appeared. It said, �Great-uncle George occupied a chair of
      applied electronics at an important government institution, was attached
      to his position by the strongest of ties, and his death came as a great
      shock.�

      Kate (Tolly) Roby, who owns the Harlan House next to the Stargazer Stone
      in Chester County, Pennsylvania, reports that on Chester County Day last
      October, �1,500 very appreciative folks came through the house and got to
      hear all the history of the Harlans, Mason and Dixon, etc. The lawn is
      destroyed, but it was worth it! And all those massive clean-up/fix-up
      projects that got done!!! There is nothing like a deadline.�
    </p>

    <p>
      The day before the event, Roby visited with some Harlans who stopped by,
      and she directed them to our Web site (www.harlanfamily.org). She writes
      that the day after, she had a �fabulous visit with a descendant of the
      last Harlans to live here�Frank Harlan Markle, Jr. He brought his family
      and a very old photo album and a 1935 diary kept here. They are priceless.
      I am going to try to reproduce both.&nbsp; I�ll pass along any gems that I
      think might be good for the newsletter.�
    </p>

    <p>
      She also corresponded last summer with Ed Danson, who wrote a book about
      Mason and Dixon (see story, page 1). �We have a positive avalanche of
      information going back and forth across �the pond�. It has been a real
      Harlan kind of summer,� she writes.

    <br /><b><font size="+1">�Discover Your Heritage�</font></b>

    <p>
      As some of you know, we�re a little over a year away from our next great
      family event, the 2002 national reunion, to be held June 27-30 in the
      Wilmington and Philadelphia area. This will be another major event like
      Celebration 300 in New Castle, Delaware, where around 800 people attended,
      and the 1997 reunion in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, with over 500 attendees.
    </p>

    <p>
      We hope you will plan to join us. It�s a great opportunity to plan a
      family vacation to see historic sites important both to our family and to
      our country.
    </p>

    <p>Here are the basic facts:</p>

    <p>
      <b>WHO</b>�All people whose family trees includes Harlans. This, of
      course, includes Harlans with different last names or spellings of the
      name.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>WHAT</b>�The third national reunion in recent years of The Harlan
      Family in America. This is a great opportunity to meet new Harlan
      relatives, to visit with those you already know, and to learn more about
      our family�s history.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program is still in the planning stages, but so far we are working on
      tours of the Harlan sites, history workshops, a family picnic, a talent
      show and services at one of the Quaker meeting houses where the original
      Harlans attended. In fact, the graveyard there is full of Harlan cousins,
      and we have already placed a plaque there in their memory.
    </p>

    <p>
      A tentative list of workshops follows, but please send us any new&nbsp;
      ideas you&nbsp; may have:&nbsp; touring the Harlan Family Web site,
      finding your family members in Alpheus Harlan�s book, the life of Supreme
      Court Justices Harlan, using your computer for genealogical research and
      record keeping, the history of the Harlan crest, our roots in England,
      history of the Quakers, and how to plan a (smaller) family reunion.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have any other talents or interests to share, please fill out and
      return the form on page 6.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>WHEN</b>�June 27-30, 2002

      <br />Repeat, yes, that�s the summer of 2002. After the reunion, you can
      spend the July 4th week visiting Philadelphia, seeing Independence Hall
      and the Liberty Bell. Also, Washington, D.C., New York City, and other
      attractions are nearby.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>WHERE</b>�The reunion facilities (lodging and meeting rooms) will be
      located in Wilmington, Delaware, a short distance from Philadelphia. As
      our theme suggests, �Discover Your Heritage,� the whole area between
      Philadelphia and Wilmington is rich in Harlan history. Our first Harlan
      cousins reached colonial Delaware in 1687, arriving in what is now New
      Castle. They came from England, seeking the freedom to live as Quakers
      without persecution. They settled throughout the area, and eventually
      spread all across the country.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>WHY</b>�Because we're very proud of our heritage and want all family
      members to

      <br />know about it!
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>VOLUNTEERS NEEDED</b>�Committees are forming to arrange for such things
      as rooms, meals and the program. We think we have some great activities
      planned, but we need help to make all of this happen. We will send
      complete information about

      <br />lodging and the program to those who indicate their interest (see
      form).
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also help by passing the word to other Harlans who may not have
      heard about this great event. The Harlan Family in America has become one
      of the country�s leading family heritage organizations. Even the Church
      of&nbsp; Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints has been impressed�they asked
      to link their extensive genealogical resources into some of the
      information on our Harlan family Web site.
    </p>

    <p>
      It�s up to all of us who treasure this heritage to help keep it alive and
      to pass it on. Don�t miss out on this great event!

      <br />From Reports by Harold Spradley
    </p>

    <p>
      <i
        >Editor�s Note:&nbsp; Jackie and Harold Spradley of Houston sent reports
        of two genealogical trips to England recently, with brief stops in
        �upper Northumbria� (Newcastle and Durham) and more time in Yorkshire.
        The following is a compilation of those reports, including the
        genealogical information they found.</i
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      The Spradleys arranged for research time at several libraries and records
      offices to see 16th and 17th Century wills and parish records from towns
      around North Yorkshire, known points of origin for the Harlands. They had
      heard that the Whitby Archives Museum was open seven days a week and had a
      significant file of Harland information, so they went there the first
      Sunday. The museum was open, but not the family history department. So
      they looked at exhibits on the role Whitby played in the young days of
      Captain Cook.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Monday, Harold spent the entire day at the Borthwick Institute of
      Historical Research (U. of York). He writes, �I collected a large list of
      indexed wills from the 16th to 18th centuries, as well as some information
      on Harlands listed as �Freemen of York� in the 15th and 16th centuries.
      The parish registers of births, marriages and burials were not very
      satisfying at the Borthwick.�
    </p>

    <p>
      For those, he went to the North Yorkshire County Records Office. Most
      visitors to the County Records Office are interested in Family History
      research. Harold pulled some microfilms and �found that (like the wills at
      Borthwick) most of the information prior to 1650 is fragmentary, very hard
      to read (frames of faded script on fragments of paper), and has large
      gaps. I tried to read a couple of dozen records�prohibited by the
      librarians from using my digital camera to make copies. They do not have
      any microfilm printers for use by researchers.
    </p>

    <p>
      �I found that a number of parishes had been indexed, with a single line
      description, containing date, given name and surname, letter code for the
      event (such as �c� for christening, �m� for marriage, �b� for burial)
      together with another name for marriage partner or father�s given name for
      christening. A few parishes had these indexed and printed in books.�
    </p>

    <p>
      Harold says that visitors can�t make photocopies, but for about 10 pounds
      sterling (around $15) per page, the librarians will make a printout from
      their computer database. Harold ordered printouts �containing about 250
      individual events of Harlands in the time frame between 1550 and 1800. I
      DID glean some materials that do not seem to exist at any other place!�
    </p>

    <p>
      On another trip to the Borthwick Institute in York, Harold collected other
      information from records accumulated by the Yorkshire Archaeological
      Society in the latter 1800s. Visitors there are restricted from access to
      the actual or microfilm records without an appointment (set weeks in
      advance), but he was able to get to the library�s index room. He
      writes:&nbsp; �There, I noted that the Institute holds copies of the wills
      of scores of Harlands in the 16th and 17th century. I copied down the
      Volume and Folio numbers of all those that seemed relevant. (The library
      does not seem to have a copy machine in the index room; so researchers are
      required to make such notations longhand.) I found at least 8 or 10
      William Harlands who might be candidates

      <br />for the elusive father of James, Alpheus Harlan�s #1.�
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the Volume and Folio numbers he had obtained, Harold ordered �the
      wills of Henry Harland (1580), a Robert or two, as well as three Johns and
      four Williams that could pop up as credible ones for our ancestry. There
      are also some candidates for James #1, in the 1660 to 1680 time frame.�

      <a name="Six Generations of Kentucky"></a
      ><b><font size="+1">Six Generations of Kentucky Harlans</font></b>

      <br />by John L. Harlan
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, it has been my pleasure to help a good number of people
      named Harlan (including recognized and accepted variations of that
      spelling), find their roots, find their ancestors, find their way home. I
      have discovered in the process of helping, that many of these individuals
      trace their roots back to Tompkinsville (Monroe County), Kentucky.
    </p>

    <p>
      This isn�t too surprising to me since my father and four previous
      generations of Harlans have Kentucky roots, and the Monroe County area was
      where they called home. It should come as no surprise to other Harlan
      researchers that their ancestral path may wind its way back to the
      Commonwealth of Kentucky. For those unfamiliar with this land, it may
      conjure up images of Daniel Boone, mountains, tobacco farms, moonshiners
      and beautiful race horses. Kentucky is all this and much more. I�d like to
      tell you about Monroe County.
    </p>

    <p>
      Geographically, Monroe County is located in the heart of southcentral
      Kentucky, in the upper Cumberland hills, rolling beautiful farming
      country, dotted with tobacco farms and some small industry. Monroe County
      has only three incorporated towns, including the county seat of
      Tompkinsville; the other two are Fountain Run and Gamaliel. There are 19
      small unincorporated communities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Gamaliel is located near the Tennessee-Kentucky border in southwest Monroe
      County, while Fountain Run is on the border of Barren and Allen Counties
      to the west, Tompkinsville is about eight miles from the Tennessee border.
      The Cumberland River winds through the southeastern part of Monroe County,
      and the Barren River cuts through the southwest section. There is a state
      operated ferry on the Cumberland River connecting two segments of Kentucky
      214, as it winds through the beautiful and scenic Turkey Neck Bend section
      of southeastern Monroe County.
    </p>

    <p>
      Old Mulkey Meetinghouse is located in Monroe County, holding considerable
      historical and religious significance; it is one of the oldest churches
      west of the Alleghenies. In the Old Mulkey State Park and Shrine burying
      grounds, in addition to Harlans and family, they also have Hannah Boone,
      sister to Daniel Boone. The architecture and construction of the Old
      Mulkey church is unique and symbolic. It is built in the shape of a cross
      with twelve corners said to represent the twelve apostles or twelve tribes
      of Israel, with three doors representing the Holy Trinity. If you are
      planning a visit to Tompkinsville, Old Mulkey should be on your list of
      �must see� items. I almost forgot the family ties, Christian Minister John
      Mulkey�s daughter married #806 Joel Wright Harlan, and apparently John
      Mulkey�s wife, Betsey Hayes, had her own Harlan connection, her mother. In
      1820, five Harlan names appeared on the church rolls.
    </p>

    <p>
      When my cousin, William B. Harlan, a college professor at Mississippi
      Southern (now Southern Mississippi), died prematurely, his parents Jim and
      Susan Harlan, gave land and money for the William B. Harlan Memorial
      Library, dedicated October 16, 1966, and it should be on the agenda of
      every Harlan researcher headed for Tompkinsville. In addition to being an
      outstanding well staffed facility, they also have Dayton Birdwell, a
      Monroe County historian and genealogist. I am the proud owner of volume
      number 772 of 1000 of a limited edition book compiled by Dayton Birdwell
      and published by the Monroe County Press, Inc., �The History of Monroe
      County Kentucky 1820-1988,� copyrighted 1992 by William B. Harlan Memorial
      Library.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have five first cousins still living in Tompkinsville, children of my
      father�s sisters, but none with the Harlan name.&nbsp; There are currently
      twelve Harlan listings in the Tompkinsville phone book, and probably all
      are related to my branch of the tree, though I�m unaware of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      When my father graduated from Tompkinsville in 1939 to attend school in
      Nashville, the population was slightly under 2,000, about what it is
      today. The current population of Monroe County hovers around 12,000, and
      it has 330 sq. miles, amounting to a population of 34.5 individuals per
      square mile. It would be an understatement to say life moves at a slower
      pace here. It moves at its own pace, not much influenced by what the rest
      of the world was doing. One thing that stands out from my boyhood travels
      to Tompkinsville was the honesty and trust people had for each other. That
      is not to say that everybody was good�they did have their outlaws�it�s
      just that everybody knew who they were and what to expect of them. I have
      seen money transactions and big money sales made on a handshake.
    </p>

    <p>
      Things are changing in Tompkinsville. I am still trying to adjust to the
      fact that they have a new WalMart Super-center just north on 163, not too
      far from my grandfather�s farm. I don�t think anything has caused such a
      stir since the �pipeliners� came through. I think of it as the quaint,
      slow paced little town where old men sat around the court house square
      with sharp wit and sharp knives making cedar shavings and pieces of folk
      art.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the things I have made a part of my trips home to Kentucky, is to
      visit the cemeteries and locate the graves of my forebearers. I have a
      list of twenty-two of these burying grounds,&nbsp; and I will provide that
      information&nbsp; to anyone who needs it. Even though I was never a
      resident of Kentucky, I still feel a strong attraction to the Bluegrass
      country and find it hard to

      <br />keep a dry eye when I hear �My Old Kentucky Home� played for the
      Kentucky Derby. With all these generations before me, I can�t help but
      trace my roots to Kentucky.

    <p>
      One fun rainy day activity is exploring genealogy with children on the

      The most comprehensive list is Cindislist. I haven�t explored all of her
      links, so I suggest you explore the sites before showing them to your
      children. Cindi has the site indexed with a list under the subtitle �Kids
      and Teens� at:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <a href="http://www.cyndislist.com/kids.htm"
        >http://www.cyndislist.com/kids.htm</a
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      One must-see site is the USGenWeb for Kidz:&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~usgwkidz/"
        >http://www.rootsweb.com/~usgwkidz/</a
      >

      <br />It encourages children to explore and discover on their own, and
      it�s their own kid-oriented site.

      ><b><font size="+1">Harlan Family Board of Directors</font></b>
    </p>

    <p>
      The officers and the board of directors of The Harlan Family in America
      have been meeting once or twice a year since the 1997 Reunion in Mt.
      Pleasant, Iowa. At&nbsp; our&nbsp; last meeting, we thought family members
      might like to hear more about what we do.
    </p>

    <p>
      Actually, our meetings are wonderful excuses for mini-reunions, so along
      with taking care of business, we spend our time together sharing
      genealogical information, eating great meals, staying up late visiting and
      enjoying fellowship.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the formal part of our meetings, we discuss organizational details
      and give direction to various activities including the&nbsp;&nbsp; Web
      site, the newsletter, Alpheus� book, budgeting and long-range planning.
      Our long-range goals include: 1) Continue to identify new Harlans,&nbsp;
      2) Build interest among family members, 3) Continue to develop
      genealogical resources and knowledge, 4) Identify and preserve Harlan
      historic sites,&nbsp; 5) Maintain a strong and efficient organization, and
      6) Create and foster activities to enable Harlans to be good, responsible
      citizens (which may eventually include a scholarship fund).
    </p>

    <p>
      The membership of the board represents ten states. All members pay their
      own expenses to attend meetings, which are open to all Harlans. Dates and
      places of meetings will be posted on the Web site. (For a list of

        ></b

    </p>

    <p>
      According to our English �cousin� Erasmus Harland, Scarborough Council
      will put up a plaque on the house where Edward Harland was born on May 5,
      1831, in Newborough, Scarborough. He was the second son of Dr. William
      Harland and a brother to Aurelius Harland. (See �Who�s Who� on Harlan Web
      site.)&nbsp; He was apprenticed to the engineering firm of Robert
      Stephenson and became the founder of Harland &amp; Wolff, the shipbuilders
      of Belfast and maker of the Titanic. (See&nbsp;
      <a href="http://www.geocities.com/razgbr/SirEdwardHarland.html"
        >http://www.geocities.com/razgbr/SirEdwardHarland.html </a
      >)
    </p>

    <p>
      His father, Dr. William Harland, was born at the Birch farm in Hartoft in
      1887. Erasmus� ancestor was Isaac Harland, the younger brother. The
      connection with the American Harlans is not clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bill Harland of Dallas, OR, says that his father spent time in England in
      the 1950s and determined that the Sutton Hall Harlands of Yorkshire were
      related to the Hartoft family. The Hartoft Harlands may have been
      connected with the descendants of Sir Richard Harland who fought on the
      side of the Royalists in the English Civil War. Richard�s brother, Captain
      William Harland, was a Cromwellian, and after the restoration of the
      monarchy, had to flee from the retribution visited upon the �regicides�
      (King killers). Unfortunately, the line of descent connecting the Sutton
      Hall Harlands with Edward Harland�s ancestry hasn�t been determined yet.
    </p>

    <p>
      On May 5, 2001, a plaque will be placed on the Harland house in
      Newborough, and Erasmus Harland will give a talk on the Harland Family in
      the Scarborough Library. There will be a display of some original letters
      and family items as well as readings from letters.
