          Ninety-four Harlans and friends met in Richmond for the July 2000
          Indiana Harlan Reunion. They learned about their Quaker heritage,
          visited Harlan graves and as usual, talked and ate a lot!

          <p>
            Decorating the front of the meeting hall at Norwich Center Lodge was
            the large blue Harlan Reunion banner seen at the national reunion in
            Iowa in 1997, to which Sue Harlan had added �Indiana� and&nbsp;
            �July 8, 2000.� Alongside it was Mary Ann Harlan�s commemorative
            quilt, with pictures from Mount Pleasant, which she won in a raffle
            at the 1997 reunion.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Saturday program told the story of the Quakers and their
            migration to Indiana, some of whom were Harlans who settled in or
            near Richmond. Thomas Hamm, archivist of the Friends Collection at
            Earlham College in Richmond, was the speaker. He told about George
            Fox, who founded the Society after a series of revelations about
            inner light. He described some of the strict&nbsp; rules of conduct
            by which Quakers were expected to live.
          </p>

          <p>
            He talked about historical records available for genealogical
            research into our Quaker ancestors. Quaker graveyards frequently
            lack headstones or have headstones with very little information, so
            Quaker histories and periodicals from the individual societies are
            very helpful sources.&nbsp;
          </p>

          <p>
            The reunion program also included the reading of a grandfather�s
            memoirs, Denver Harlan�s by Jim Harlan, both of Richmond. Harlans
            also toured a house owned by Levi Coffin, one of a number of Quakers
            who sheltered runaway slaves as part of the �underground railroad,�
            and the small community church and cemetery at Bethel, whose pioneer
            settlers included many Harlans.

          Diana Wells. They displayed some of their family history posters
          afterwards.

          <p>
            In the display room different Harlan cousins displayed information
            from their genealogical research, and Sue and Jim Harlan manned the
            �store� with shirts, jackets and other Harlan items.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overnight guests stayed at the Norwich Center Lodge or a nearby
            motel. Meals together Friday and Saturday nights rounded out the
            reunion activity.

          <p>
            Junior Harlan of Arizona announced the dates of June 28-30 for the
            2002 national reunion. Members of the national Harlan Family board
            met at Richmond during the weekend to discuss the national reunion
            plans.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thirty relatives from the reunion attended a Sunday worship service
            at the Friends Meeting in Richmond and led the congregation in
            singing the Harlan family�s song, �A Family of Friends�, composed by
            Becky Gaskill and introduced at Celebration 300 in 1987.

    <p>
      At the Harlan Family Board Meeting in Chadds Ford, PA, held in October,
      1999, the editorship of The Harlan Record was an issue. When former
      editors Tom and Marylee Harlan stepped down, four Harlans stepped forward
      with offers to help. The idea of using an editorial board was discussed
      and agreed upon, and the following have volunteered to help put together
      future issues of The Harlan Record. (Ideas from ALL readers are welcome.)
    </p>

    <p><b>C. J. King, Editor, </b>Jamaica, VT</p>

    <p>
      C. J. grew up in Indiana and received her B.A. in journalism from Ball
      State University. She has been a professional writer and editor for more
      than 20 years. In 1995 she earned an M.F.A. in writing from the University
      of Massachusetts.
    </p>

    <p>
      She teaches English composition, other writing courses and literature for
      the Community College of Vermont. She taught oral history methods and
      interviewing techniques to sixth and seventh graders in southern Vermont
      last spring, and she hopes to continue that project.
    </p>

    <p>
      She writes and publishes on a wide-range of subjects, including biography,
      arts, and history. She has written a book about the radical acts of the
      Lincoln women, which is seeking a publisher.
    </p>

    <p>
      C. J. was first introduced to family history with a tale from her father�s
      side, about a kind man who saved an ancestor from suicide. In college, she
      studied about the Harlans�her mother�s side�in a class on family and
      social history. She learned more while researching her book and by
      attending Indiana reunions and the Iowa reunion in 1997.
    </p>

    <p><b>Ed Wynn, Contributing Editor, </b>Las Vegas, NV</p>

    <p>
      Ed was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1934, the youngest child of
      Harold R. Wynn and Anna Rebecca Harlan. He served in the Navy during the
      Korean War, then spent nine years with the National Security (NSA) and
      Central Intelligence (CIA) Agencies. He graduated from American University
      in Washington, DC.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the past 30+ years he has been involved in new home sales. Currently
      he owns&nbsp; and&nbsp; operates GENESIS New Home Sales Training, Inc.,
      and travels the country conducting training seminars and consulting with
      home builders.
    </p>

    <p>
      He and his wife, the former Rosemarie Pedoto, attended the Harlan Reunion
      in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa.
    </p>

    <p>
      His area of expertise is the Harlan men in the Civil War. He wrote a story
      for the Harlan Family Web site entitled �The Harlan Ghosts of Gettysburg.�
      He has been compiling a book called �The Final Muster, The Harlan Men in
      the Civil War.� He has identified about 600 Yanks and 200 Rebels to date,
      and he says, �It is going to be a forever job to get all their records.�

    <p><b>Diana Harlan Wells, Contributing Editor, </b>Atlanta, IN</p>

    <p>
      Diana attended Lincoln Christian College and finished her degree at
      Hamilton University.
    </p>

    <p>
      �I have always worked with children and young adults,� she says. She
      home-schools her daughter, Dawn, and has researched the home schooling
      phenomenon. She also has organized children�s programs for Indiana Harlan

      <br />reunions.
    </p>

    <p>
      At a ladies tea for Civil War Days in Atlanta, Indiana, Diana played
      Senator Harlan�s wife, Ann Eliza (Peck) Harlan, reading letters written to
      her daughter, Mary. Written by one of Mary�s girl-friends, they are
      high-spirited and full of teasing remarks about the President�s son and
      Mary�s other beaux.
    </p>

    <p>
      �My grandmother Mimi (Helen Harlan) was always interested in the family
      history and encouraged me to start researching more of our family line.
      Then I was hooked. I have researched and compiled four family histories,�
      Diana explains.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her great interest at the moment is exploring online sources for
      genealogists and helping put databases online for everyone to use.

    <p>
      In 1997, The Harlan Family in America made a generous donation toward a
      study for renovating the Harlan-Lincoln Home in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa.
      Located on the Iowa Wesleyan College campus, the home was owned first by
      James Harlan, an early president at the college, a U.S. Senator, and a
      friend of and cabinet member for President Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>

    <p>
      The daughter of James Harlan married Robert Todd Lincoln, and their
      children spent numerous summers at this home. It now serves as a museum
      for Harlan and Lincoln artifacts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The renovation costs are estimated at $650,000. Some grant money may
      become available but contributions to preserve this piece of
      Harlan-Lincoln history are needed. Contributions will be tax deductible.
    </p>

    <p>
      For more information contact Lynn Ellsworth at the college�1-800-582-2383.

      Those of us who work on the Harlan Web site try to keep it fresh and
      alive. A few months ago we added a new section entitled �Historical Harlan
      Documents.� We have two documents so far that should be of interest to
      most

      <br />of us.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first document was obtained through the efforts of William Marion
      Harlan (MO) and Arthur Chapman (Portadown, Northern Ireland) and is the
      original hand-written copy of the marriage certificate of George Harland
      #3 and Elizabeth Duck.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second document pertains to a William Harlan and was scanned from an
      old book which has been passed down through generations. It starts with
      William Harlan (#474) and his son, David Kimbrough Harlan (#1732) who
      purchased the book for $6.00 in 1841. We�ve heard that copies of this
      document, which is on parchment paper, are very vivid.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have copies of Harlan documents of the past that might be of
      interest and wish to share them, send them by either of these methods: 1)
      scan the page, upload it with an e-mail, and send to
      nalrah@aol.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or

      <br />2) if you do not have a scanner, mail a copy of the material to
      Larry Harlan, 6158 Mill Run Road, Monticello, MN 55362-3611.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please do not send the original as we cannot be responsible for its
      safety. Include a short paragraph describing the significance of the
      document and tying, wherever possible, to the person�s number in the Green

        <br />by Ed Wynn&nbsp;&nbsp; (edwynn@prodigy.net)

    <p>
      When Emory Brooks Harlan (#4775) was born on December 16, 1837, as the
      eighth of Enoch W. Harlan (#1730) and Lucinda Buck�s ten children, there
      was no indication that he would become the highest-ranking officer among
      the hundreds of Harlans who would serve on both sides during the Civil
      War.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emory was born in Wilmington, Adams Township, Ohio. On December 31, 1861,
      shortly after the beginning of hostilities, he was commissioned as a 2nd
      Lieutenant in Company D of the 49th Illinois Infantry. He was mustered
      into service at Camp Butler, Illinois, when he was 24.
    </p>

    <p>
      Col. William R Morrison commanded his Regiment. On February 3, 1862, the
      Regiment was ordered to Cairo, Illinois. On the 8th, it moved to Fort
      Henry where it was signed into the 3rd Brigade, McClernand�s Division. On
      February 14th, Emory�s unit engaged the enemy at Fort Donelson, Tennessee,
      lost 14 men killed in action, and had 37 wounded.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emory evidently took to the military life quickly. On March 22, 1862, he
      was promoted to 1st Lieutenant and left his unit to assume his duties as
      Acting Adjutant General on the staff of Brigadier General Hugh Boyle
      Ewing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Taking time away from his duties, he was married to Mary Crundwell on July
      4, 1864, in Marion County, Illinois, by the Reverend T. F. Kouts. A
      Certificate of Record of Marriage was filed by Mary on October 25, 1883,
      in connection with her Widow�s Pension Application.
    </p>

    <p>
      On November 12 of that same year the bridegroom was advanced to the rank
      of Captain and designated as the Assistant Adjutant General of U. S.
      Volunteers on the staff of Major General John M. Palmer in the Army of
      Cumberland.
    </p>

    <p>
      On March 13, 1865. shortly before the Confederate&nbsp; surrender at
      Appomattox, Virginia, he was appointed Brevet Brigadier General, United
      States Volunteers for �meritorious services during the war.� Two months
      later his first son, Emory C. Harlan, was born (June 9, 1865) in
      Springfield, Illinois where the family had established its home.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to young Emory, he and Mary had three other sons: Paul P.
      Harlan (May 17, 1870); Edgar Harlan (January 18, 1872); and Brooks E.
      Harlan (November 11, 1875), all of whom were born in Springfield.
    </p>

    <p>
      General Emory B. Harlan died on November 20, 1875, in Springfield, just
      ten years after the end of the Civil War, one month short of his 38th
      birthday.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mary�s Pension Application states that he �died of disease contracted in
      the service of his country.� This disease was identified in the Pension
      Application as �Chronic Diarrhea.� Thus a humbling disease which felled
      thousands of Union and Confederate troops, including many of Emory�s
      cousins, took the life of the Harlan family�s highest ranking Civil War
      officer, long after the war had ended.

      One of my favorite times is late at night when the house is quiet and I
      can research genealogy on the Internet. The databases and Web sites that
      are online are exciting to use. I like many different sites; some are paid
      and others are free. I would like to share three of the free sites that I
      use.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Church of the Latter Day Saints (LDS) site,
      <a href="http://www.familysearch.org">http://www.familysearch.org</a>

      has their Ancestral file, International Genealogical Index (IGI), and
      Pedigree Resource files online. The LDS search engine also searches the
      Internet for family name Web sites, by last name only.
    </p>

    <p>
      I use the LDS site to see what other family researchers have discovered.
      Recently, I found a marriage record for one of my ancestral lines. I
      checked out the information with other sources, and it&nbsp; was&nbsp;
      accurate. The&nbsp; site&nbsp; is a great help if you need a name, date,
      event, state or country supplied. It is plain fun to surf through the
      records.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful,&nbsp; though,&nbsp; as&nbsp; the LDS church does not take
      responsibility for the information donated, so as always, double-check
      your sources.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rootsweb at
      <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com">http://www.rootsweb.com</a>&nbsp; is a
      great site. It has several different features, but one of the best is the
      mailing list for queries and information. I subscribe to several lists,
      which can be sorted by name, topic or state. I like the Harlan family
      mailing list.
    </p>

    <p>
      The List owner is the moderator of the list. To receive the Harlan mailing
      list queries, type

      <br />Harlan-L-request@rootsweb.com in the address line and then type
      subscribe in the subject and body of the message. I have found some
      cousins, family lines and yes, even errors, through the lists. People
      are&nbsp; usually&nbsp; great&nbsp; on&nbsp; the lists, very helpful and
      free with their information.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think this is a great genealogical&nbsp; tool;&nbsp; the only drawback
      can be the massive amounts of e-mail you receive. I love e-mail, so it�s
      great fun for me.
    </p>

    <p>
      Genforum is a message-board based genealogical tool.&nbsp; Its address
      is:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com">http://genforum.genealogy.com</a>

      <br />Genforum has family names, topic, county and state forums. If
      Genforum does not have the message forum you need, you can request one.
      You can post a query or answer a query.
    </p>

    <p>
      Genforum has one search engine for all of the forums, then each forum has
      its own search engine. I have used both searches and found them helpful.
      The best feature about Genforum is that when someone replies to one of
      your postings or queries, Genforum sends you an e-mail so you know you
      have had a reply. I have found this helpful, as I do not have to keep
      going back to the site day after day.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Harlan Forum is fun. I go to see what family cousins need help with
      their genealogy. Check it out!

      <br />The Internet Explosion of online data is great. Do not be afraid;
      just point, click and go!

    <p>
      NEW CASTLE, PA�The phone company and the Harlan family have a long
      distance relationship�one covering four generations.
    </p>

    <p>
      It started June 17, 1929, when David F. Harlan was hired as a transmission
      man for American Telephone and Telegraph, now known as AT&amp;T. �There
      were only about two people with phones in Harlansburg then,� said the
      92-year-old native of Harlansburg who now lives at Jameson Place on
      Wilmington Road. �Of course, there was also one in each store.�
    </p>

    <p>
      Jonathan Harlan, of whom David is a direct descendant, laid out the
      village of Harlansburg in 1800. He built the first house and operated a
      grist mill east of the village, according to the Lawrence County
      Historical Society.
    </p>

    <p>
      David measured volume levels and performed other duties with co-workers
      for more than 43 years until retiring on July 31, 1972. He recalled a time
      when a telegraph was used to communicate between cities. During World War
      II, he was sent to Washington D.C., while the Pentagon was under
      construction. There, he worked on the telegraph.
    </p>

    <p>
      At times, David allowed his son, Fred, to visit him at work at the
      then-AT&amp;T facility in Union Township. The youngster would watch the
      teletype in action. When Fred graduated from high school, David used his
      connections to land his son a job.
    </p>

    <p>
      �The morning after the all-night party, I woke up and Dad left me a note
      to go to AT&amp;T and see someone. I was a temporary employee for summer.
      At end of summer, they put me on full time,� recalled Fred, 65, of the
      East Side.
    </p>

    <p>
      He began as a splicer�s helper and then advanced to lineman, pole
      inspector and desk man. However, when the office position became
      automated, the pay dropped and Fred returned outside to work as a
      repairman. He retired in October, 1995, after more than 42 years of
      service.
    </p>

    <p>
      �It was a good job. Some of the best times were when we went out on ice
      storms and things like that,� he recalled. �We traveled to New England,
      Maryland and Rhode Island during the �50s.
    </p>

    <p>
      �For the first so many years, they used to ship us out of town quite a
      bit. Later, manpower was cut down so much, there weren�t enough men to
      send out of town.�
    </p>

    <p>
      As his father before him, Fred allowed his son, Scott, to tag along on the
      job. �I remember when I was little, my father would get called in the
      middle of the night because phone lines would go down during a storm or
      something,� said Scott, 40, of Slippery Rock Township. �Occasionally, he
      would let me go out with him. He�d climb the pole and work on the line,
      and I would stand on the ground and hold the light.�
    </p>

    <p>
      Scott eventually answered the phone company�s call, too. After working for
      Westinghouse Electric in Baltimore, Scott returned to the area in 1988.
      Fred informed him that the cellular phone business was in its infancy and
      the job market was wide open.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;�The cellular business was just starting to grow at that time,�
      Scott recalled. �In 1984 Bell Atlantic Mobile Systems originally started a
      cellular business in Pittsburgh.�
    </p>

    <p>
      Beginning as a customer service representative, Scott rose to the rank of
      system performance engineer. �Our job is to optimize the cellular system,�
      he explained. �My van is equipped with test equipment, cellular phones and
      laptop computers, all used to test the signal and optimize the system.
      Occasionally, we get customers who call and say their cellular phone
      doesn�t work well on a certain stretch of highway. I go out there and
      drive that area and collect data.�
    </p>

    <p>
      Another of Fred�s children, Sharon Ross, and his grand-daughter, April
      Ross, work as communications assistants at the AT&amp;T Relay Center in
      the Cascade Galleria. �I was very excited to follow in my father�s and
      grandfather�s footsteps into the telephone business,� said Sharon, 43, of
      Hickory Township. �It�s about the best job you can find.�
    </p>

    <p>
      While the communications field has witnessed continual growth and changes,
      the Harlan family has remained a constant in the telephone industry.

              To maintain our Harlan Family Association and to provide for the
              up-front costs of our 2002 national reunion, monetary
              contributions of any amount are needed. Our organization does not
              require dues�rather it is supported by donations from interested
              Harlan family members to whom we express our appreciation for past
              assistance.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to Reunion expenses, the Association is making an
              effort to reach additional descendants of George, Michael and
              Thomas Harland, over and above the number on our current mailing
              list of 1,300+ names. We believe all of our Harlan cousins have a
              right to know about our family�s proud heritage, and plans have
              been made to send an introductory brochure and newsletter to
              several hundred additional Harlan descendants.
            </p>

            <p>
              Please consider making a contribution to help with these

      <b>Subject: George Harlan</b>

      <br />I keep hearing about the document that George signed for William
      Penn. Does anyone have a copy of it? George was a signer of the Great
      Charter. I want to find out more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <p>
      <b>Subject: Early Harlan Records</b>

      <br />I am still searching for copies of the early Harlan Record. I
      searched the St. Louis Genweb area and the site said to contact an agency
      in Columbia, MO, about newspapers. I just sent them a letter.
    </p>

    <p>
      The librarian in Madison, Ill., searched their archives but could find
      nothing on John Harlan or the Harlan Record. Wild, considering he lived
      there and was the editor.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have queries out on the Madison County, IL, and St. Louis Genweb
      projects, the Harlan List at rootsweb and on the MO list itself. I will
      let you all know if I hear of anything.

      ><b><font size="+1">Harlan Reunion in Maryland</font></b>
    </center>

    <p>
      Saturday, July 8, was the beautiful, sunny summer day that we had hoped
      for as our Harlan family reunion began. It was held in the home of Pat and
      Larry Huff in Damascus, Maryland, and co-hosted by Pat Huff and her cousin
      Claudia Steigler.
    </p>

    <p>
      Four generations were represented�from age 82 to one year old.
      Geographically we came from Maryland, Virginia, Michigan, North Carolina,
      Florida, Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas, Indiana and New York. We were
      welcomed by John Barrows who photographed each individual or family as
      they arrived. Joy abounded as the house and yard filled with aunts, uncles
      and cousins until those in attendance numbered 48.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Huffs� dining room table was loaded with food for our mid-afternoon
      meal. As we filled our plates, our attention was drawn to a display on the
      buffet of some photographs of our ancestors and a newly compiled Family
      Tree that had been neatly organized by computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      The remainder of the afternoon was filled with sharing family news and
      photographs, fun in the outdoor swimming pool and the downstairs� pool
      table. We ended the day with a group picture taken by our own family�s
      photographer, Kenneth Harlan Owen.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are delighted to announce that during the month that has passed since
      the reunion, our numbers have increased by two! Anna Grace was born July
      14, and Kaelyn Maree arrived July 31.
    </p>

    <p>
      This was our third reunion. The first was in 1980 at Tuckahoe State Park
      on Maryland�s Eastern Shore, and the second was held in 1990 at Woodside
      United Methodist Church in Silver Spring, Maryland.
