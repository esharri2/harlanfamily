<p><a name="buildings"></a><b><font size=+1>ORIGINAL HARLAN BUILDINGS STILL

IN USE IN PENNSYLVANIA</font></b>



</center><table cellspacing=8 cellpadding=3 cols=2 width="100%" >

<tr valign=TOP>

<td>&nbsp; Anyone who has traveled&nbsp; in&nbsp; Europe has surely marveled

at the sheer age of the buildings there. Worn stone steps carved by countless

feet, aspiring cathedral towers, aqueducts, and walled stone castles all

serve to remind us how far back our history goes.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlans who tour the Brandywine Valley area of Pennsylvania

can get a tangible sense of how far back our history goes in this country.

Two homes built by first-generation Harlans, sons of George and Michael,

are still homes today, and the two original Quaker Meetings, around which

the first American Harlans centered their lives, still serve congregations

today.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Harlan Log House, on Fairville Road in Chadds

Ford, was built on land deeded from George Harlan (#3) to his son Joshua.

It is now both a family home and a bed and breakfast. Guests stay in the

original section of the house, which Joshua built with squared-off logs

sandwiched between layers of mortar and rocks. Now on a parcel of five

acres, the building originally sat on 200 acres deeded to Joshua&nbsp;

�in consideration of natural affection and Fatherly love.� An 1814 spring

house stands near the house which is listed on the National Register of

Historic Places.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Harlan House/Stargazer Farm is also on the National

Historic Register. This stone house was built c.1724 by Michael Harlan�s

son George (#14) on purchased land that was originally granted to William

Penn in 1681. Harlan descendants lived in the house until 1950.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now the home of veterinarian and Harlan history

friend, Dr. Kate Roby, who is also a freelance medical writer. Roby is

in the process of restoring the building and has discovered curious aspects

of the Harlan history in the process.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place is called the Stargazer Farm because this

was the winter retreat of Mason and Dixon during the four years they spent

surveying the Pennsylvania-Maryland border

<br>�the Mason-Dixon line. Here, they built an observatory, worked out

mathematical calculations and studied the stars.&nbsp;

<br>Located near Roby�s home is �The Stargazers� Stone�.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlans who gathered in Chester County, Pennsylvania,

for an informal reunion last October also toured two historic Quaker meeting

houses that are still in use today. Our Harlan ancestors sat in these two

buildings, on rough-hewn wood plank benches, and waited in silence until

some member felt inspired by the musings of his or her spirit. In the absence

of one appointed minister, in the absence of any set&nbsp; order&nbsp;

of&nbsp; service, they&nbsp; believed the word of God would come through.

For the right to worship this way they risked crossing the Atlantic Ocean

and rebuilt their lives in a foreign wilderness.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old Kennett Meeting House, one of these two buildings,

is on Route 1, a few miles west of the Brandywine Battlefield Park. Established

in 1710, it is currently inactive. However, services are held in the Old

Meeting House at

<br>11:00 a.m. on the last Sundays of June, July, and August. Arrangements

can be made for visits by interested groups.</td>



<td><img src="../images/KennettMH.jpg" border=2 height=189 width=281>

<br>In keeping with Quaker simplicity, the graveyard next to the building

originally had no gravestones. Later, plain markers, low to the ground,

were used. This graveyard has a historical marker placed by the Harlan

family in 1987, on the occasion of our family�s 300th anniversary of arrival,

and in honor of our ancestors who helped found that meeting house.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Old Kennett Meeting House was the site of a skirmish

during the American Revolution. On the morning of September 11, 1777, British

and Hessian troops began marching east along Route 1, then called the Great

Road, heading toward colonial troops positioned near where the road crosses

the Brandywine River.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first shots of this battle took place at a tavern

nearby (no longer standing). Immediately after that, the Brits called for

reinforcements and ran down the road to take cover behind the stone walls

on the Old Kennett Meeting House grounds. They fought with the Colonial

troops here mid-morning, while the pacifist Quakers continued to hold their

midweek service. One of those who worshiped there that day later wrote

that, �While there was much noise and confusion without, all was quiet

and peaceful within.�

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From here, the soldiers fought while traversing the

three miles between the meeting house and what is now Battlefield Park.

Eventually the British pushed back the revolutionary troops, but not before

suffering heavy losses.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; George and his wife Elizabeth, and Michael and his

wife Dinah, built homes far enough away from their original Meetings, that

in time they wished to establish a new meeting house closer to them. The

Harlans and another family, the Hollingsworths, petitioned the congregation

for the right to separate, which was granted, and Centre Meeting was formed.

Services were first held in private homes before a log cabin was built

in 1711. The present brick structure, built in 1796, still serves an active

congregation which is in the process of a long-range project to restore

the Centre Meeting building. They are working carefully to preserve it

as close to original form as possible. For example, they have resisted

putting central heating into the building because, as George Whitesides,

our guide, explained, that kind of heat would crack the original wood beams.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are also undoing mistakes made by previous generations,

like cement used 30 years ago which is not compatible with the original

mortar, and painted ceilings that kept dampness from rising and evaporating.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whitesides has been attending this meeting house

for some 20 years. Meetings are held here year-round, heated in the winter

by a wood stove. Business meetings are held once a month. An average of

25 people attend each&nbsp;

<br>meeting, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<center><a name="ChaddsFord"></a><b><font size=+1>October Gathering at

Chadds Ford</font></b></center>



<p>In the afterglow of the Harlan Family Reunion at Mount Pleasant, Annette

and John Harlan and Bob and Liz Sly arranged a more informal gathering

of Harlans held at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, in mid-October. Some 42 people

from 18 states came to touch base with each other and also with our ancestors,

George and Michael.&nbsp; There were several new faces as well as many

old friends. Our president, Bob Harlan, seized the opportunity to hold

a board meeting of The Harlan Family in America during which our next national

reunion was discussed.

<p>To get our visiting off to a jump start, John and Annette Harlan hosted

a wine and cheese reception on the first evening of our visit. Tom and

Marylee Harlan were presented a plaque in recognition of the many years

they served as editors of The Harlan Record. We were also pleased to have

our family historians, Martha and Elgene Smith from Chadds Ford, at the

reception.

<p>The following morning we met at the Old Kennett Meeting where Martha

Smith had arranged to have Tom Taylor discuss various aspects of the Quaker

worship service, the structure of the building, the cemetery, etc.&nbsp;

We also visited Centre Meeting where George Whitesides explained the restoration

work that is underway. He spoke of their care in preserving the building

in its original form as closely as possible and practicable.

<p>Another treat was an invitation tendered by Dr. Kate Roby to visit her

home, the �Stargazer House�.

<p>The house of George�s son, Joshua, is also still extant. Called �The

Harlan Log House�, it has been extensively renovated and is operated as

a bed and breakfast. Tom and Marylee Harlan stayed&nbsp; there&nbsp; while&nbsp;

in&nbsp; Chadds&nbsp; Ford, and several of our group toured the old part

of the house. Many of our group visited the Chester County Historical Society,

the official repository of the Harlan family documents.&nbsp; These were

arranged on a table for our perusal, and we enjoyed reading the old newspaper

clippings, cemetery records, etc.&nbsp; Of particular interest were a few

letters written to and from Alpheus Harlan during the period he was researching

the Harlan family history.

<p>Last, but not least, I mention the fine evening meal hosted by Mary

Harlan Murphy. We all enjoyed her beautiful home, more visiting, and the

wonderful meal served up by Mary and her friend Sue. The guest of honor

this evening was Mary�s uncle, Edward S. Johnson (#9953 vi), one of the

last living persons listed in Alpheus Harlan�s History and Genealogy of

the Harlan

<br>Family.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><a name="board"></a><b><font size=+1>Harlan Board Has October Meeting</font></b>



</center><p>The editorship of The Harlan Record was one item discussed at the last

board meeting of The Harlan Family in America. A decision was made to form

an editorial board, and Connie Jo (C.J.) King was appointed �editor-in-chief�.

Serving with her are:

<blockquote>John L. Harlan from Alabama

<br>Diana Harlan Wells, Indiana

<br>Ed Wynn from Nevada.</blockquote>

Other items on the agenda included:

<br>�&nbsp;&nbsp; setting a tentative date/location for the next national

reunion (2002, possibly in Pennsylvania area);

<br>�&nbsp; creating a master list of all Harlan descendants in America;

<br>�&nbsp; studying a long-term plan of action to implement the goals

of the Harlan mission statement.

<p><a name="book review"></a><b><font size=+1>Book Review on Irish Quaker

Immigrants</font></b>



</center><p>The Immigration of Irish Quakers into Pennsylvania, 1682 -1750, by Albert

Cook Meyers, should be required reading for the Harlans. Originally printed

in 1902, it has been reprinted several times, most recently in 1994. Whereas

the emphasis of Alpheus Harlan�s History and Genealogy&nbsp; of the Harlan

Family is entirely upon the Harlans and collateral relatives, Mr. Meyers

sets forth the story of the Quakers in England, Ireland and Pennsylvania,

thereby creating a historical setting for our Harlan families as they immigrated

to the New World.

<p>The book is divided into three parts: �The Planting of Quakerism in

Ireland,� which sets forth the history of the Quakers in England and Ireland;

�The Migration of Irish Friends to Pennsylvania,� which describes the inducements

that led the Friends to come to Pennsylvania, the places from which they

came, and the dangers of the voyage; and �The Irish Friends in Pennsylvania,�

perhaps the most interesting to us. It depicts the various meetings, social

life, housing, equipment, dress and discipline. Each monthly meeting is

covered in great detail and the genealogies of the various families are

set forth.

<p>Edward S. Johnson is one of the few living Harlans listed in Alpheus

Harlan�s book. Born November 27, 1912, he is registered as �vi� under the

six children of his father, William Henry Johnson (#9953) and mother, Mary

Louisa Harlan.

<p>The cutoff date for inclusion in the book was around January 1, 1913,

and it was published in 1914. Johnson, who has Harlans on both his maternal

and paternal lines, used to go to Harlan reunions in Indiana back in the

1920s. His father was particularly interested in family history and met

Alpheus Harlan that way. Johnson�s father was �so proud� to help with Alpheus�

project by supplying information about&nbsp; the Harlans in Pennsylvania.</td>

<td><a name="mystery"></a><b><font size=+1>Mystery Surrounds&nbsp; Stargazer

House</font></b>

<p>For those of you who like to solve a mystery, here�s a Harlan mystery.

Kate Roby, better known as Tolly, is a veterinarian who now owns the stone

Harlan house on the Stargazer Farm. She has collected some puzzling statistics

about a string of Harlan deaths.&nbsp; All but one were men, and most victims

were in the prime of their lives. According to Roby:</td>



<td><img src="../images/stargazer.jpg" border=2 height=182 width=283 align=RIGHT></td>

</tr>

</table>

�The interesting thing is that with all the deaths of Harlan men and relatives

or neighbors, all apparently in the prime of life, there seem to have been

no deaths of women, or children, or young men, which would seem to rule

out an infectious disease.

<p>�The following Harlans died in 1732:

<br>� George Harlan (#14) age 42, Newlin Twp, (immigrant Michael�s son;

he was the original owner of the Stargazer Farm);

<br>�&nbsp; Stephen Harlan, his brother, age 35 (lived next door);

<br>� Solomon Harlan, his brother, age 30, London Grove Twp, (father�s

house);

<br>� Joel Baily, father-in-law, age 50-60, Marlborough Twp;

<br>� Isaac Baily, brother-in-law, age 37, Marlborough Twp;

<br>�&nbsp; Aaron Harlan, son of George (#3), George�s (#14) first cousin,

age 47, Kennett Twp?;

<br>� Robert Johnson, Isaac Baily�s brother/father-in-law, age?, New Garden

Twp.

<br>�Other non-relatives include:

<br>� Nathanial Newlin, age 42, Concord Twp, owned land next door;

<br>� Moses Mendenhall, age 38, Kennett Twp;

<br>� James Miller, age 38, Kennett Twp.

<p>�A scan through the Will Book of Chester County has turned up many more

who seem to have died in that year-50, so far, and I have only gotten through

the �J�s�. Much more work is needed to see when these deaths actually occurred,

how old they were, if they were sick, etc.

<p>�Other families did lose more than one member: John and Thomas Baldwin;

Thomas and Aaron Barnard; John and Robert Chamberlain; Edward and Thomas

Dutton; but not to the extent of the Harlans, so far at least. �The only

possible death of a child I have found so far is the son of Abigail Johnson

Wickersham Baily and Isaac Baily (above): Jacob is listed in the genealogy

as one who �died young�; but I have no date of birth, except a tentative

c.1732-33, and no date of death.

<p>�There was a smallpox epidemic in 1731, but that was apparently before

the deaths in Chester County. The high mortality in Chester County that

year could possibly be a remnant of the smallpox epidemic, but that does

not explain the peculiar pattern of deaths in the Harlans.

<p>�In the Will book search, only one woman has shown up so far, Elizabeth

(and Nigel) Gray, (father-daughter/husband-wife?) died in 1732.

<p>�Such a pattern may suggest poisoning from a source that only the middle

aged-older men had access to (e.g. booze?), or if an infectious disease,

then something with an intermediate host that only the middle aged or older

men were exposed to. One medical colleague suggested mumps as affecting

adult men more severely than women/children, but the mortality rate seems

much too high for mumps, but perhaps not too high in that period?

<p>�Whatever it was, it had a fairly long course, at least 3-4 months,

and a very high mortality rate. The Harlans mostly wrote wills around January-February,

saying they were sick, and most seem to have died by April although Aaron

died in November.

<p>�It must have been a devastating time for the Harlans and many others

in Chester County, as a huge part of the labor force and means of survival

was lost.�

<p>If anyone can shed light on the cause of this strange string of deaths,

it will help solve an old mystery on our family tree. Send any information

to The Harlan Record.

<center><a name="shoe"></a><b><font size=+1>Concealed Shoe Found in Stargazer

House</font></b></center>



<p>Kate (Tolly) Roby�s efforts to restore the Harlan house on the Stargazer

Farm led workmen to uncover a rare relic of superstition placed by earlier

Harlan builders.

<p>Early last October, when&nbsp; workmen took off an old cedar shingle

roof and the tin liner beneath it, they found an old shoe, along with two

blown-glass bottles. The Chester County Historical Society dated these

to c. 1825.

<p>The short woman�s boot was about nine inches long, with a leather sole,

well-worn, no heel, and black silk uppers. The holes are still there, but

the laces have disintegrated.

<p>Roby believes the shoe must have been placed atop the stone wall of

the building before a new roof was put on around 1825. By then, that part

of the house was already as much as 100 years old. She thinks the shoe

may have been placed in memory of Hannah Harlan, wife of Caleb, who died

around that time.

<p>The tradition of burying a shoe inside a house as it is being constructed

goes back to England. This practice is supposed to protect the house�s

inhabitants from the evil eye, according to an article on the subject in

the April 1999 issue of Early American Homes.

July 8</font></b>



</center><p>Indiana Harlans will gather July 8, 2000, in Richmond at the Norwich

Lodge and Conference Center of Earlham College. The campus of this Quaker

college in eastern Indiana was once farmed by Jesse Bond and wife Phebe

(#1820 in Harlan Genealogy, a descendant of George�s son, Ezekiel #5).

<p>The Norwich Center offers excellent facilities for the reunion which

begins with registration and refreshments at 8:30 a.m. The registration

fee of $20, for each, covers the noon meal, program expense and refreshments.

<br>(Children:&nbsp; meal cost only)

<p>Tom Hamm of the Earlham staff will speak about the migration of Quakers

into Indiana. The Levi Coffin House, which was a stop on the slave escape

route of the �underground railroad�, will be visited as well as the tiny

town of Bethel, once populated by many Harlans whose names are on markers

in the cemetery. These Richmond area Harlans and other Harlans hosted the

National

<br>Reunions at the 200th and 225th year anniversaries of our family in

America.

<p>Displays, field trips, making new friends, discovering relatives and

helping those tracing their Harlan roots can all combine to make it an

enjoyable and memorable day. A children�s program is planned also.

<p>Guest rooms for overnight stays July 7th and 8th may be reserved. Some

are planning to see more of Richmond before the reunion and stay over to

attend the Quaker meeting Sunday morning.

<p><br><a name="west"></a><b><font size=+1>By George!&nbsp;&nbsp; Harlans

Who Went West</font></b>



</center><p>One wonders how many �George Harlans� have lived in America. The first

known George (#3) did not name a son after himself, but there are numerous

other descendants with the title.

<p>A grandson of George (#3)-James (#46)-used the name for one of his sons

(George #218), born about 1750. Around 1760 the younger George and his

widowed father moved to Virginia where James later married Dinah Harlan

Davis (#70), a descendant of Michael Harlan (#4).

<p>Just prior to James� departure from Chester County, Pennsylvania, he

installed a marker at the site of his first wife�s grave at Old Kennett

Meeting. Since this violated the Quaker discipline, he was later disowned

by the Friends.

<p>George (#218) served as a �wagon boy� in the Revolutionary War. He later

married Mary Wright, and they had ten children, with the fifth child named

George (#852) also. The family eventually moved to Ohio, where the youngest

George married Elizabeth Duncan before moving on to Berrien County, Michigan.

The couple had seven children and were caring for some of the children

of George�s deceased brothers, including a nephew named George W.

<p>In 1845, the urge to move west to California caused the large extended

family to pack up 11 wagons and leave their Michigan home. According to

daughter Mary, after George (#852) decided to go to California they prepared

the wagons by fixing the beds of the wagons with compartments which had

lids on them, similar to a cupboard laid down. In these they kept their

effects, food, and clothes. At night they spread their mattresses and bedding

over these and slept inside the covered wagon.

<p>The Harlan Party wintered in Lexington, Missouri, and were joined by

the Donner Party as they headed westward. They experienced great difficulties

at Weber Canyon in Utah, and eventually the Donners took another route

west which proved tragic for them. The Harlans continued on and reached

California in late 1846.

<p>Two weeks after arriving in California, George�s wife, Elizabeth, died

of typhoid fever. He later married Catherine Fowler Hargrave, a widow,

and in 1849 Catherine�s sister, Minerva Jane Fowler, married George�s son,

Joel. Then Catherine�s son by her first marriage wed the granddaughter

of George. In the summer of 1850 George, too, died of typhoid fever.

<p>Elizabeth Maxwell Heidt of Walnut Creek, California, furnished some

interesting facts for this article, in addition to the photos below.

<a name="marriage"></a><b><font size=+1>Copy of George &amp; Elizabeth�s&nbsp;

Marriage Certificate Received</font></b>

<p>Through the efforts of William Marion Harlan (Columbia, Missouri) and

Arthur Chapman (Northern Ireland), a copy of the marriage certificate of

George Harland and Elizabeth Duck made its way to mid-America.

<p>Spelled out is the date of �the twenty seventh day of the ninth month

of 1678�, contrary to the date of 9, 17, 1678 found in Alpheus Harlan�s

book of Harlans. To obtain this copy, it was necessary to obtain written

permission from the local Society of Friends. Then someone had to pick

up the copy in person from the Public Record Office with permission in

hand, which Mr. Chapman of Portadown, N.I., consented to do. Those who

went on the Ireland leg of the 1994 Harlan Family tour will remember that

Mr. Chapman was among those who greeted the group at the Friends Meeting

House in Lurgan.

<p>Thanks, Marion, for obtaining this very interesting document.To see

a copy of the hard-to-read document and a "translation", which contains

the names of 28 witnesses, visit the Harlan Web site and go to the link

entitled �<a href="../documents.htm">Historical Harlan Documents</a>�.
