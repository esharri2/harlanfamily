      <td>We're just beginning to celebrate the 200th anniversary of one of our 

        nation's most important events--the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 

        In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson got Congress's approval for 

        financing an exploration of uncharted Western lands. From 2003-2006, 

        the discoveries of these venturesome men will be celebrated at various 

        junctures of their route. The journey was 8,000 miles and lasted 28 months. 

        The cost was estimated at $2,500. </td>

  <p align="left">Geographer <b>James D. Harlan</b> of Missouri has an important 

    connection to this historic observance. He has recreated maps of the Lewis 

    and Clark journey across Missouri territory by combining information from 

    their journals and early U.S. General Land Office surveyor field notes, and 

    adding land-cover information obtained from satellite imagery and aerial photography. 

    Jim put all the findings into a geographic information system database, and 

    what emerged is the most accurate record to date of Lewis and Clark's trek. 

  </p>

  <p align="left">Jim is assistant program director at the University of Missouri's 

    Geographic Resources Center in Columbia. He has spent over six years developing 

    his data- collection and mapmaking methods. Jim has been a teacher and researcher 

    at the University since 1996. Previously, he worked for telephone companies 

    and as a soldier in the U.S. Army and the Missouri National Guard. </p>

  <p align="left">Born in Moberly and raised in Cairo, Mo., by James Walter and 

    Betty Harlan, Jim has loved maps, geography and history all his life. </p>

  <p align="left">The accompanying photograph shows Jim sitting on Wolf's Point 

    near Lupus, Mo., and was taken by Ira Block from National Geographic. An article, 

    &quot;Lewis and Clark's Lost Missouri,&quot; appeared in the April 2002 issue 

    and featured Jim Harlan, the mapmaker. </p>

  <p align="left">According to Jim, his project &quot;stirred up a hornet's nest 

    across the country,&quot; since his updated, accurate maps have challenged 

    some towns' claims to fame. The supposed route followed has now been redrawn 

    to show that some stops made by Lewis and Clark were actually in other locations. 

    Jim's ancestral line includes: George #3, James #11, John #44, Isaac #207, 

    Isaac #797, Washington #2717, Isaac Newton #6803, James Virgil, and Jim's 

    father, James Walter (J.W.) Visit Jim's Web site of Lewis and Clark information:

          gave some interesting and unknown insights into Alpheus's later life:</p>

        <p align=left>&quot;In 1918, Grandfather Alpheus was nearly helpless with 

          progressive paralysis and spent days in an invalid's chair with broad 

          arms and a footrest. One day Mother lifted me onto the arms of the chair 

          so that the two of us could have a good look at each other. No words 

          were spoken. To tell the truth, I do not remember the incident but was 

          reminded of it many times.</p>

</td>

      <td><img src="../images/Alpheus.jpg" width="263" height="407"></td>

    </tr>

  </table>

  <p align="left">&quot;Several years earlier, Alpheus had lost the use of his 

    right hand, the fingers knotted with what was then known as writer's cramp, 

    better known today as carpal tunnel syndrome. The BOOK was then at a critical 

    final stage. Son William (#9716) dropped out of college to spend the next 

    three years compiling the index, a massive job, plus proofreading, working 

    on additions and corrections, and making contacts with the Lord Baltimore 

    Press. William also took on a local teaching job to supply seriously lacking 

    income.</p>

</center>

<p align=left>&quot;The BOOK finally went to press at Lord Baltimore with a run 

  of 800 copies. Four hundred were immediately bound in dark brown board with 

  a leather facing along the back edge. These went immediately to those who had 

  pledged $10 each. The remaining 400 copies, unbound, were bundled in twenties 

  and shipped to the home in New Burlington, Ohio. In the next 70 years they would 

  be bound in lots of six to meet yearly sales that averaged five. The BOOK was 

  never a best seller. </p>

<p align=left>&quot;It all started in a visit by Alpheus in 1881 to an old cousin 

  down in the country who presented him with a treasure trove of old letters, 

  some going back into the 1700s. From these letters he learned of his great-grandfather 

  Enoch (#117), who died in North Carolina but had been born in Chester County, 

  Pa. It then came out that there were still Harlans in the Brandywine settlement 

  and also valuable records kept in the Quaker meeting house at Chester. Meeting 

  house records provided the links back to Ireland and ultimately to England. 

</p>

<p align=left>&quot;Correspondence became enormous, and Alpheus's life was 'pen 

  in hand'. He did acquire an 1890 typewriter and taught himself to type. Of course, 

  he had to make a living, and his occupations ranged from bookkeeper at a small 

  coal mining operation in southern Ohio; postmaster in the village of New Burlington; 

  Justice of the Peace; agent for fire insurance; agent for a number of magazines; 

  agent for the ONT Thread Co.; secretary for the Claysville and Hocking Valley 

  Spur line with 20 miles of track, one locomotive and 10 years in operation; 

  secretary of the Miami Cemetery Association; and secretary of the Masonic Lodge. 

  His handwriting was the sort called Spencerian. </p>

<p align=left>&quot;When the family got together, the talk was often of Harlans, 

  past and present. Connections were also important. I remember my mother saying, 

  'If you ever meet someone named Hollingsworth, shake hands because they are 

  connected.' Thirty years ago, on Amtrak and passing through Wilmington, Del., 

  there was this roadside sign, 'Harlan &amp; Hollingsworth Ship Repair,' Also 

  in the ship business were 'Harland &amp; Wolff' of Belfast, the company that 

  built the Titanic. Then there were the Boones. Somehow, the Harlans got tied 

  in with Daniel and followed him into Kentucky and helped out at the battle of 

  Blue Lick. </p>

<p align=left>&quot;Mother firmly believed that since Harlans were firstcomers 

  in Ohio, it was her duty to welcome newcomers, whoever and from wherever. </p>

<p>Dear Harlan Friends, </p>

<p>I was born and raised on the south side of San Antonio, Texas, and attended 

schools in the Harlandale Independent School District. For many years untold 

numbers have attempted to find the origin of the name Harlandale. </p>

<p>Now that I am retired I have joined the untold numbers in attempting to solve 

  this elusive mystery. I have a secret source --my mother, who is 90 years old. 

  She said she worked for an architect and his wife, Carleton and Marcia Adams, 

  in the early 1950s. Carleton Adams, one of Texas's most renowned architects, 

  was born in Alma (Harlan Co.), Neb., and brought to Texas by his father, Jay 

  E. Adams, in 1890.</p>

<p>Jay Adams was a real estate developer, and it is believed that he was the 

developer of the proposed town of Harlandale, which was never incorporated and 

was eventually absorbed by the city of San Antonio. I have since learned that 

the namesake of Harlan County, Neb., was one Thomas Harlan, an early member of 

the first Nebraska Territorial Legislature (originally from Wyoming, I believe), 

and an associate to Jay Adams. </p>

<p>The ironic twist to all of this is that my brother, after leaving Harlandale 

High School, joined the Marine Corp. After a tour of duty in Korea he was 

assigned to a naval ammunition depot at Hastings, Neb. He met and married a 

local girl and settled in the area. During several summers I would visit him, 

and we would go fishing at his favorite spot, nearby Harlan County Reservoir. 

</p>

<p>Little did these two graduates of Harlandale High School in San Antonio 

realize, but they were fishing in the middle of a Nebraska lake with the same 

namesake as their high school. </p>

<p><b><a name="expert"></a>Expert on World's Oldest Tree Is a Harlan </b></p>

<p>Thomas P. Harlan IV, a descendant of Michael Harlan (#4) and a Texan by 

birth, is a dendrochronologist and has spent years researching the bristlecone 

pine tree. Most of these trees are in high altitude deserts of the Great Basin 

of western North America, where there is very low rainfall and sparse 

vegetation. They have been misshaped by winds, deprived of moisture, starved of 

nutrients, yet they sometimes live for 5,000 years. </p>

<p>Harlan, a retired University of Arizona tree-ring scientist, is still searching 

  for a missing link to fill a gap in a 12,000-year chronology of North America's 

  climate. Tom and his wife, Annita, a botanist and science fiction writer, recently 

  hiked and searched for bristlecone samples in the White Mountains of California. 

  They are looking for samples of both living and dead trees that will furnish 

  answers to questions about ancient climatic changes, volcanic eruptions and 

  droughts. The work is precise and complex, and Tom is an expert in finding and 

  interpreting clues. Scientists respect his ability to assign highly accurate 

  dates to tree rings. </p>

<p>Tom IV's line is: Michael #4, George #14, John #68, Thomas #290, John #1108, 

  and Thomas P. #3498, the last in the line to be listed in Alpheus Harlan's 

  book. Thomas P. was in the Texas Hill country in the 1850s, buying and selling 

  horses. He married Mary Dallas Williams in March 1869, but died five months 

  later. A son, Thomas P. II, was born after his death, allowing the continuation 

  of this line of the family.</p>

<p>Tom IV and Annita have a son, Thomas P. Harlan V, who is also a science

  <b><a name="Illinois"></a>The Illinois Harlans and Mr. A. Lincoln</b> <br>

  by Jane A. Harlan, Somerset, KY <br>

  <br>

  <br>

  <img src="../images/ArcherHouse.jpg" width="601" height="257" border="1"><br>

  <i><b>Archer House, Marshall, Ill. </b></i></p>

<p>When we think of the Harlan connection with Abraham Lincoln we usually think 

  of the Iowa Harlans, primarily Senator James Harlan (#2297) and his daughter 

  Mary (#5864). According to biographer Johnson Brigham, Senator James Harlan 

  met with Abraham Lincoln first in 1861, shortly after Lincoln was elected President. 

  But Mr. Lincoln knew the Harlans from Illinois long before he met the senator. 

</p>

<p>Senator James Harlan was born in Clark County, Ill., and a number of Harlan 

  relatives still lived there in 1861. Some of them, Mr. Lincoln had known for 

  many years, dating back even before 1830, when the Lincoln family moved to Illinois.</p>

<p>The Harlans of Warren County, Ohio, were discussed in the October 2001 edition 

  of The Harlan Record. The Zachariah Archer family also lived in Warren County, 

  Ohio, until around 1817, when they migrated to Clark County, Ill. The Archers 

  had a son named William, who later came back to Ohio and married the oldest 

  daughter of George Harlan (#672), Elizabeth (#2253). He also persuaded Jacob 

  Harlan (#2254), the oldest son, to move to Illinois with them. </p>

<p>Harlan brothers Justin (#2255), Newton (#2261) and Howard (#2262) eventually 

  moved to Clark County too, as did Uncle Silas Harlan (#677), the future father 

  of Senator James Harlan. </p>

<p>William Archer became a leader in Illinois politics and was already serving 

  in the Illinois Assembly when the Lincolns moved to Illinois in 1830. Archer 

  is recognized as the founder of Marshall, Ill., and Archer Avenue in Chicago 

  is named after him. </p>

<p>When William Archer nominated Abraham Lincoln for Vice-President at the Republican 

  National Convention in Philadelphia in 1856, he said he'd known Lincoln 

  for 30 years. This was possible. At 17, in 1826, Abraham Lincoln made a flatboat 

  trip down the Ohio River. There are no written records of what took place on 

  that trip, but it certainly placed him in a situation to meet new people. William 

  Archer also had a history of traveling on the river. </p>

<p>William Archer, Justin Harlan, and Abraham Lincoln later served together as 

  officers in the Illinois militia during the Black Hawk War. William Archer and 

  Justin Harlan were both officers from Clark County. Lincoln was an officer from 

  Sangamon County. William Archer and Abraham Lincoln also served together in 

  the Illinois legislature and were political allies supporting many of the same 

  causes. </p>

<p>After 1836, when Abraham Lincoln became a licensed attorney, legal documents 

  started to show his connections to Harlans. His travels included Clark County, 

  Ill. The Archer House in Marshall, Ill, has a sign stating that Abraham Lincoln 

  was a former guest. One record from 1842 shows that William Archer was sued, 

  and that Abraham Lincoln guaranteed payment from his own personal funds. No 

  lawyer would do that except for a personal friend. The History of Crawford and 

  Clark Counties, Illinois, describes William Archer as a devoted &quot;friend&quot; 

  of Lincoln's.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln frequently had local attorneys as co-counsel on cases, and 

  records from Clark County show Justin Harlan handling cases with Lincoln. Justin 

  Harlan was actually a judge throughout most of Lincoln's legal career 

  in Illinois. Illinois Supreme Court records include several appeals where Abraham 

  Lincoln was an attorney on the case, and Justin Harlan was the judge. </p>

<p>On May 3, 1849, while Abraham Lincoln was in Congress, Justin Harlan sent a 

  letter seeking a patronage job for a &quot;crony&quot;of theirs, implying that 

  indeed they were cronies. A news article from 1841, about Whig party events 

  in Sangamon County, Ill., showed Justin Harlan and Abraham Lincoln attending 

  the same event as allies. At that time Lincoln was supporting Harlan for a nomination 

  for Lieutenant Governor. </p>

<p>Both Newton Harlan and Howard Harlan served as Clerk of Court in Clark County 

  before becoming lawyers and moving to Washington, D.C. Existing court documents 

  from some Lincoln cases in Clark County were received by and signed by Newton 

  Harlan as the Clerk of Court. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Jacob Harlan died in 1836, the same year Lincoln got his license 

  to practice, so he is not included in any of these records, even though he served 

  as Clark County Clerk of Court several years before his death. The Clerk of 

  Court positions included many responsibilities that would be considered judicial 

  functions today. For example, there are records of Jacob Harlan probating estates. 

</p>

<p>Lincoln's continued relationship with Jacob Harlan's widow and 

  the inclusion of her home in the Lincoln Log Cabin State Historic Site, Charleston, 

  Ill., tend to confirm that Lincoln was as close to Jacob as the other Harlan 

  relatives. Visitors to the park are told that Lincoln was a frequent visitor 

  at the home of Nancy Chenoweth Harlan Sargent. He knew her first husband, Jacob 

  Harlan, as well as her second husband, Stephen Sargent, who was a progressive 

  farmer in the 1840s.</p>

<p>The children of Jacob and Nancy Harlan who lived in the Sargent home are: Burns 

  (#5732), Mary Louisa (#5733), George (#5735), and Martin (#5736). Another daughter, 

  Amanda (#5734), is buried with her father at the Darwin Cemetery in Clark County. 

  Son George later died of pneumonia while attempting to enlist in the army in 

  1865. </p>

<p>When Abraham Lincoln became President he passed out patronage positions to 

  his friends and supporters, as was and is the custom. Justin Harlan became the 

  Indian Agent for the Cherokee Indians. This was a very responsible position 

  because the Indians had been supporting the Confederacy, and the Union didn't 

  want a Western front too. Justin's son, Howard, became Postmaster of Marshall, 

  Ill. Later, he built Harlan Hall. (See Historic Site section, Harlan Web site.) 

  Senator James Harlan, from Iowa, eventually became a member of Lincoln's Cabinet 

  as the Secretary of the Interior. </p>

<table width="100%" border="0">

  <tr>

    <td> 

      <p>Johnson Brigham's biography of Senator James Harlan, published in 1913, 

        refers to James Harlan's relationship to President Lincoln as follows: 

        &quot;During the years of the war the friendship between Lincoln and Harlan 

        apparently deepened, in spite of the fact that the senator was often a 

        severe critic of the President's actions, for on public occasions 

        Harlan was nearly always to be found in the presidential party. At the 

        second inaugural on March 4, 1865, Senator Harlan was chosen as Mrs. Lincoln's 

        escort, and Miss Mary Harlan was among the distinguished group surrounding 

        President and Mrs. Lincoln at the inaugural ball.&quot; (Brigham. 196) 

      </p>

      <p>After Lincoln's death, Mary Harlan married Robert Todd Lincoln and became 

        the mother of the Lincoln grandchildren. Could the foundation of this 

        future relationship between the Harlans and the Lincolns have been laid 

        by the Harlan cousins in Illinois? </p>

    <td width="53%" valign="top"> 

      <p>From Oregon Geographic Names by Lewis A. McArthur, 1982:</p>

      <p>&quot;Harlan, Lincoln County-- James R. Harlan was one of the originators 

        of the plan to secure a post office. The office, when established about 

        1890, was named for him. He was the first postmaster according to information 

        by the postmaster in 1926.&quot; </p>

      <p>Kurt and Susie Harlan (who you may know from last summer's reunion) visited 

        Harlan, Ore., and reported, &quot;There was not much to see.&quot; Of 

        course I had to see it for myself. I found &quot;Harlan&quot; on my Oregon 

        map and in August, 2002, I drove from King City on Highway 18 to Lincoln 

        City, then on US 101 to Newport, then on US 20 (the road to Corvallis). 

      </p>

</table>

<p>I passed by Burnt Woods, a little town nearby whose name was suggested by G. 

  Downing &quot;because of previous havoc wrought by forest fires,&quot; according 

  to author McArthur. I stopped and asked at a coffee shop, &quot;Where is Harlan?&quot;</p>

<p>The waitress replied, &quot;You just passed it.&quot; She instructed me to take the 

road back to Burnt Woods and drive south to Harlan. I drove several miles and 

passed a tree farm sign which read: &quot;Fir Harvest 1943; Hardwood Harvest in 1991; 

Fir Harvest 2050.&quot; Planning ahead. </p>

<p>Where are all the 35 persons listed in the atlas as residents of Harlan? At 

the road junction where Harlan should be, there was an older home and gas pumps 

with a sign, which read &quot;Closed.&quot; No one was at home, only dogs barking. I drove 

on, past a lovely meadow where cattle were feeding. </p>

<p>The Newport News Times, November 12, 1997, described Harlan as a place where 

&quot;there were junked cars and torn apart mobile homes on the site of a former 

Harlan sawmill.&quot; I concurred. </p>

<p>Further, the report stated that Lincoln County has acquired 45 acres of 

industrial property on the aforementioned Burnt Woods'Harlan Road that year. 

There are still problems with the property, as taxes are owed to both the IRS 

and Oregon. </p>

<p>Another article from The Oregonian, published Nov. 26, 2002, reported that 

the Lincoln County voters ousted all of the Lincoln County School Board, except 

for one member. The newspaper stated that voters objected to closing an auto 

shop class at Newport High School, canceling sports at the middle school, and 

talk of privatizing busing and food service. The main objection was to closing 

Eddyville School, where Harlan children were attending, and busing the children 

to Toledo, a long bus ride. </p>

<p>Incidentally, Frank Lloyd Wright designed several Lincoln County schools in 

the 1920s: Taft Middle School, Naterlin (formerly Central School) in Newport, 

and the Toledo Junior High School. All but the Naterlin are gone. </p>

<p>In &quot;100 Years in Lincoln County, Oregon, from 1893 to 1993,&quot; Joe 

  Wilson wrote: &quot;On March 2, 1889, a post office named Harlan was established, 

  named after &quot;an early resident named James R. Harlan. It was established 

  way up on the Big Elk River not too far from Mary's Peak. A good deal of fresh 

  water in the Yaquina River comes down the Big Elk off of Mary's Peak.&quot; 

</p>

<p>The post office of Burnt Woods was started June 21, 1919, on the waters of 

the Willamette, via Shotpouch, TumTum, and Mary's Rivers. For many years there 

was a busy rock quarry at Pioneer nearby. </p>

<p>If you want to write a letter today, send it to the post office at Burnt 

Woods; there is no longer a ZIP code for Harlan, or for many other small post 

offices. Apparently the post offices served the needs of the loggers and 

families; later these small post offices were consolidated. </p>

<p>Travel notes for visitors: If you come to Oregon for the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial 

  2003-2006, drive south on US 101 from Astoria to Newport; you will pass the 

  Yaquina Light House. Follow the Yaquina River east to Elk City. Or from Newport, 

  go east on US 20 to Burnt Woods, then turn right on the road to Harlan. You 

  are now in the Siuslaw National Forest. You can picnic at the H. D. Ellmaker 

  State Park back on US 20. You may drive from Waldport (south of Newport) on 

  US 101, and then turn up US 34, look to the north at Mary's Peak. You may see 

  Mary's Peak looking southeast from Harlan. Safe journey. </p>

<p><b><a name="records"></a>Old Records Tell Most Unusual Story of Sallie Harlan 

  </b><br>

  Courtesy of Evelyn Akin, Henrietta, Texas</p>

<p>Old Land Office records of Clay County, Texas, and old newspaper files at the 

University of Texas reveal a wild story of a Harlan ancestor. The Clay County 

Leader of March 28, 2002, had this to say: &quot;Back in 1899, when Sallie Harlan was 

100, she predicted she would die. She did. Her lone cabin was located in a 

mountainous region of Texas. She lived one of the strangest lives in early 

Texas. She was the widow of two Indians. </p>

<p>Sallie's family came to the frontier country of Texas. The Indians discovered 

the cabin, and they pretended for some time to be on friendly terms with 

Sallie's family. That was in 1818, when Sallie was in her late teens. </p>

<p>Then old Iron Eyes and his roving band of redskins murdered the whole family 

but spared the life of lovely Sallie. She was then advised she would be burned 

at the stake or would she choose an Indian for a husband? She reluctantly chose 

the latter. </p>

<p>A few months after her wedding, however, another tribe appeared on the scene. 

Gambling being one of their favorite pastimes, Sallie discovered to her horror 

that she had been won by the Comanche brave named Red Deer. </p>

<p>She obediently went to live with him, but she also decided to be the boss in 

the wigwam. She succeeded so well that the other red skins derisively referred 

to him as a squaw man. </p>

<p>One day Red Deer asked her to do a certain chore, they quarreled, and Sallie 

picked up a tomahawk and brained Red Deer on the spot. </p>

<p>Sallie knew she was doomed. Jumping astride a fleet-footed mustang, she raced 

in the direction of an American settlement. She suddenly realized she had left 

behind her three-year-old son. She brooded about this constantly, and she was 

determined to save him from the savages. </p>

<p>Years later, they captured Sallie's brother-in-law, who told them that 

Sallie's son was still alive. Sallie disguised herself as a Comanche warrior and 

boldly rode to the village where her son lived. The son was now ten years old; 

he had been named White Eagle. </p>

<p>Sallie took White Eagle out into the forest and told him who she was, but he 

didn't believe her. Then the little scamp raced back to camp and aroused the 

warriors. </p>

<p>The enraged Indians captured Sallie. The squaws took off her clothes and 

whipped her until the blood flowed. </p>

<p>The old Indian chief suggested that her son pass judgment on her life. Little 

White Eagle and his mischievous playmates jabbed Sallie's body with arrows and 

spears. Then Sallie was tied on the back of a snorting mustang, which was then 

turned loose. </p>

<p>Sallie was able to free her hand. She finally met a party of Americans. She 

neither ate food nor drank water until she had sworn vengeance against all 

Indians.</p>

<p>From then on, Sallie joined any frontier company or posse in search of Indians. 

  She never spared the life of an Indian; over time, she acquired 99 Indian scalps. 

  The Comanches finally referred to her as the White Devil.&quot; </p>

<p>Sallie lived a strange life. She became one of Texas' least-known frontier 

  characters. Can anyone connect Sallie with the BOOK?</p>

<p><b><a name="genealogy"></a>Genealogy Study Has New Twist</b></p>

<p>Genetic genealogy using DNA testing is the latest trend in family research. 

Some family historians are willing to pay large sums of money to discover 

ancestral information that only their genes can reveal. </p>

<blockquote>

  <p>From <i>Family Tree Magazine</i>: <a href="http://www.familytreemagazine.com">http://www.familytreemagazine.com</a><WWW.FAMILYTREEMAGAZINE.COM>: 

    &quot;If you've been tested, you might be wondering if others who share your 

    surname have been tested. And you're probably curious about how many long-lost 

    relatives you have, just waiting to be found. DNA Heritage's Ybase provides 

    free search and submission capabilities anyone can use.&quot; </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The Harlan Family of America recently received an e-mail from Lawrence M. Packer 

  of Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation, a not-for-profit foundation that 

  creates data bases of genealogies and genetic information. He would like to 

  make others aware of its worldwide project and invites interested people to

<p><b><a name="reunion"></a>Board Plans Next Reunion </b></p>

<p>The Harlan Family Board met in Independence, Mo., March 29, 2003. They 

discussed several issues, concentrating mostly on a review of the 2002 reunion 

and plans for the next one in 2007. </p>

<p>The next reunion is tentatively being planned in the Reno, Nevada, area for 

late June or early July 2007. In addition to affordable hotels and airfare, it 

is reportedly a very clean city with a number of family-oriented attractions 

(Lake Tahoe, Virginia City, the Bonanza Ranch, an antique automobile museum, and 

a ghost town, among others). </p>

<p>The Reno area is significant to Harlans because it is close to the Donner 

Pass. The Harlans and Donners traveled together for part of their journey west, 

but the Harlans traveled on ahead through the pass, escaping the Donners' 

unfortunate fate. </p>

<p>A site committee will visit Reno this fall to explore the possible 

accommodations and attractions. We're looking for local volunteers to help plan 

the reunion. To volunteer or offer suggestions, please e-mail Harlan Family 

President Bob Harlan at rharlan@succeed.net. </p>

<p>Items remaining from the Harlan Store are still available. (See Web site for 

pictures.) To order, contact Ruth Harlan Lamb at harlamb@aol.com. </p>

  <p align="left"><b><a name="proverbial"></a>The Proverbial Brick Wall</b><br>

    by Cynthia Rhoades, Director of Genealogy</p>

  <p align="left">Although many people have run up against obstacles in their 

    research, this was my first in a long time. I was researching the marriage 

    date for a relative who was supposed to have been married in 1930.</p>

  <p align="left">The year was late enough that good records existed by then, 

    but I could not find any mention of it at the county seat records office. 

    None of the other family members knew when the couple was married or even 

    where the wedding took place. I even tracked down a long lost cousin hoping 

    she might have some old family records, but she wasn&#146;t any help either.</p>

  <p align="left"><br>

    I finally resorted to going through the little weekly hometown newspaper that 

    told things like who was visiting Aunt Millie for dinner on Sunday and who 

    was down in bed with a bug. I even read that my mother had a slumber party 

    to celebrate her 13th birthday. And after going through week after week, I 

    finally found a mention that the couple had been married at the courthouse 

    of the county seat.</p>

  <p align="left"><br>

    So back to the courthouse I went. It still was not listed in the index, but 

    I started through the book of marriage records for 1930, page by page, and 

    was finally rewarded with the marriage application. Not only did I find the 

    application but also learned some new information about each set of parents 

    that I hadn&#146;t known previously. </p>

  <p align="left"><br>

    Even though you think you&#146;ve tried every avenue to find information, 

    don&#146;t give up. More than likely it&#146;s just waiting to be found. It 

    pays to be resourceful and diligent, so keep looking!<br>
