			<h2><a name="fish"></a> Louis R. Harlan; Pulitzer-winning Historian</h2>
		  <h4>By Matt Schudel<br>
				Published in The Washington Post, 
			Jan. 29, 2010 <br>
			Reprinted by permission of The Washington Post </h4>
			<p><img src="/record/images/louisharlan.jpg" alt="Louis Harlan, PhD." width="252" height="276" align="left" style="padding-right:10px;">Louis R. Harlan, 87, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at
				the University of Maryland whose two-volume biography of Booker T. Washington
				made him one of thenation’s foremost scholars of the history of race relations,
				died Jan. 22 at a nursing facility in Lexington, Va. He had Crohn’s disease,
			a chronic digestive disorder.</p>
			<p> Dr. Harlan, who taught at Maryland for more than 25 years, devoted
				much of his scholarly careerto Washington, who was born into
				slavery in Virginia in 1856, led theTuskegee Institute in Alabama and was
				perhaps the country’s most prominent black leader at the start of the 20th
			century.</p>
			<p> The first volume of Dr. Harlan’s biography, “Booker T. Washington:
				The Making of a Black Leader,1856-1901,” came out in 1972 and
				was awarded the Bancroft Prize, the most prestigious annual honor
				in the field of American history. After the second volume, “Booker
				T. Washington: The Wizard of Tuskegee, 1901-1915” was published
				in 1983, Dr. Harlan won the Pulitzer Prize for biography, a second
				Bancroft Prize and the Albert J. Beveridge Award for the best
				book on American history.</p>
			<p> His monumental study covered more than just the life of a single
				man, albeit a significant and complex one. Historians saw the
				two-part biography as a beautifully  
				written portrait of black American life during the nation’s darkest
			days of segregation.</p>
			<p> C. Vann Woodward, who was often called the dean of Southern history
				and who taught Dr. Harlan in graduate school, wrote in the New
				York Times in 1983: “In a review of the first volume of this
				superb work of scholarship more than 10 years ago, I wrote, ‘If
				the second volume measures up to the first, Harlan’s biography
				of Booker Washington will be the best study we have of a black
			American.’ It is.” </p>
			<p> Dr. Harlan delved into more than 1 million archival items in
				the Library of Congress to compile his biography and the 14-volume
				“Booker T. Washington Papers” (1972-1988). Raymond W. Smock,
				who helped edit the papers and last year published a short biography
				of Washington, said of his onetime mentor: “By any definition of
			the term, he was one of the leading historians of the 20th century.” </p>
			<p> During the early years of the civil rights movement, when Dr.
				Harlan began his research, the study of Booker T. Washington
				was not a popular subject. When Jim Crow laws were prevalent
				and lynchings were common, Washington championed a non-confrontational
				approach to race relations, maintaining that hard work and self-reliance
				would improve the lot of black Americans. He fell into disfavor
				among a later generation of black leaders, many of whom thought
			he was too willing to make accommodations with white authority.</p>
			<p> Dr. Harlan made the case that Washington was a deeplycomplicated
				man. “Washington’s life and thought were layered into public,
				private, and secret,” Dr. Harlan wrote, “and also segmented according
				to which subgroup of black or white he confronted. For each role,
			he wore a different mask.” </p>
			<p> Among Washington’s 14 volumes of writings, Dr. Harlan wrote,
			there was “not a single love letter, not a cry of joy.”</p>
			<p> Louis Rudolph Harlan was born July 13, 1922, in West Point, Miss.,
				and grew up in Decatur, Ga. He was on the swimming team at Atlanta’s
			Emory University, from which he graduated in 1943. </p>
			<p> During World War II, he was a Navy officer aboard a landing craft
				that transported troops to Omaha Beach on D-Day. He wrote a memoir of his
			Navy years in 1996, “All at Sea: Coming of Age in World War II.”</p>
			<p> He received a master’s degree in history in 1948 from Vanderbilt
				University in Nashville and a doctorate in history in 1955 from
				Johns Hopkins University, where his mentor was Woodward. </p>
			<p> As a white Southerner, Dr. Harlan might not have seemed a likely
				candidate to write the biography of a black leader. But as a
				graduate student, he met John Hope Franklin, an African American
				historian then at Howard University, who encouraged the young
				scholar to study the history of race relations in the South. Dr. Harlan’s
				first book, “Separate and Unequal” (1958), explored racial inequities in
				Southern schools.</p>
			<p> He joined the NAACP in the 1950s, held leadership posts in the American
				Civil Liberties Union and participated in civil rights marches
				in Washington and Montgomery, Ala., with the Rev. Martin Luther
				King Jr.</p>
			<p> Dr. Harlan taught at what is now Texas A&amp;M University at Commerce
				and the University of Cincinnati before joining the Maryland
				faculty in 1966. In 1985, he was named a distinguished university
				professor, U-Md.’s highest faculty honor. He was the first person
				to be president of all three major scholarly organizations in his field—the
				American Historical Association, Organization of American Historians and
				Southern Historical Association —at the same time. </p>
			<p> Dr. Harlan cut a striking figure on campus with his weathered
				face and a bushy mustache that made him look like Wild Bill Hickok.
				He once shaved it off, his wife said Thursday [Jan. 28, 2010],
				but she didn’t recognize him and asked him to grow it back. He
				retired in 1992 and moved to Virginia in 2000.</p>
			<p> Survivors include his wife of 62 years, Sadie Morton Harlan of
				Lexington; two sons, Louis K. Harlan of Ronceverte, W.Va., and
				Benjamin W. Harlan of Second-creek, W.Va.; a sister [Harriet
				Harlan of Tallahassee, Fla.]; and a grandson.</p>
			<p> Of all the lessons to be learned from history, Dr. Harlan said,
				the most important may be this: “The wisdom of one era is the
				foolishness of another.” </p>

<h2><a name="blue"></a>Harlan Items Featured on Antiques Roadshow</h2>
<h4>By Betsy Chittenden, Vienna, Va. </h4>
<p> Harlan Family readers may be interested to know that a piece of Harlan furniture
	from the StargazerFarm, the historic Harlan property in Chester County,
	Pa., where Mason and Dixon stayed for several winters while surveying the
	Mason-Dixon line, was featured on Antiques Roadshow recently. The show was
	taped in Atlantic City during the summer of 2009 and aired January 25, 2010.</p>
<div style="width:360px;padding:0 5px 0 5px;float:right;margin-left:10px;border:1px solid #999;"><p align="center"><img src="/record/images/roadshow.jpg" alt="John Hays and Tom Chittenden" width="350" height="298">John Hays, appraiser, and Tom Chittenden </p>
	</div>
<p> The piece of furniture is a candle stand dating from the mid- 18th century,
	so it was probably originally made or purchased by Joel Harlan (#72). The
	candle stand stayed in the farmhouse and with the family, and thus would
	have been owned successively by Caleb Harlan (#305), Joel Harlan(#1191),
	Henry Kirk Harlan (#3727), Mamie E. (#8270) and Annie (#8271) Harlan, and
	my mother, Virginia Markle Chittenden. </p>
<p> Virginia Markle Chittenden (1921-2009) was the daughter of Frank Harlan Markle,
	the only child of Mamie Harlan (#8270) and Frank Markle. While she was growing
	up in Paoli, Pa., outside of Philadelphia, she and her brother frequently
	visited their grandparents at their home, the Stargazer Farm, in Embreeville,
	Pa., where they lived with Mamie’s unmarried sister, Annie.</p>
<p> My mother loved the time she spent there, remembering it as very old-fashioned
	by 1920s standards (electricity was not put in until about 1926). She and
	her brother ran about in the fields and with the neighbor children. They
	spent a lot of time playing in Brandywine Creek with an old rowboat that
	her grandfather kept there.</p>
<p> Her grandfather was a well-known tinkerer in the neighborhood and very skilled
	at fixing clocks and machines. He also apparently made small items from old
	cigar boxes and the like. The Markles and Annie, being elderly, did not actively
	farm themselves, but leased most of the land to neighbors. They did keep
	chickens, and sold some of the eggs. We have a diary that my great-grandfather
	Frank kept in 1934 and 1935; it is filled with the sort of daily events that
	happen on a small rural farm —visits from neighbors, comments on the weather,
	trips to Westchester, and every day a note on the number of eggs that the
	chickens had laid. My mother recalls an old woman coming to visit often,
	from the county “home” that was nearby, who was supposedly the last Lenape
	Indian in Chester County.</p>
<p> The house at Stargazer Farm was probably built or possibly expanded by George
	Harlan (#14); there is a date stone with the date 1724 on it. The house was
	not sold out of the family until the 1950s when Mamie, Frank and Annie had
	all passed away, and their son Frank Markle, Jr. could not afford to keep
	it. Although I have not researched the actual chain of deeds, we assume that
	the house generally passed in ownership from George Harlan(#14) to Joel Harlan
	(#72), to Caleb Harlan (#305), to Joel Harlan(#1191), to Henry Kirk Harlan
	(#3727), and then to his daughters, Mamie and Annie. </p>
<p> When the house was sold, my mother and her brother obtained a number of furnishings
	from the house, all of which my mother knew to be there in the 1920s. Much
	of the furniture in the house had apparently passed down from generation
	to generation with the house itself. </p>
<p> Sadly, my mother passed away this past summer at the age of 88. Her brother
	had predeceased her in 2004. </p>
<p> This past June, my brother, Tom, and his wife, Tracy, obtained tickets to
	an Antiques Roadshow taping in Atlantic City and took several Harlan items
	to be appraised. Standing in the furniture line, he was pulled out of line
	by one of the appraisers who had spotted the candle stand he was holding
	and wanted to see it immediately.</p>
<p> The actual on-camera appraisal was done by one of the show’s regular appraisers,
	John Hays of Christie’s. He dated the candle-stand at around 1750, so we
	presume it was made or purchased by Joel (#72), whose dates are 1724-1796.
	And yes, he gave it a value —$8,000 to $12,000! Mr. Hays said that stains
	on the stand’s top were genuine port wine stains—possibly where Joel himself
	spilled his drink. Needless to say, Tom and Tracy never did make it to any
	of the other lines to get their other items appraised that day. </p>

<p> There are many items from the Stargazer Farm in the family that we hope to
	find more about in the future, either through Antiques Roadshow or other
	means— including an early 19th century grandfather clock, a large sampler
	done by Margaretta Ann Baily [wife of Joel (#1191)], the 1781 marriage certificate
	between Caleb (#305) and Hannah Edwards, and other treasures. </p>
<p><i> Editor’s Note; The Stargazer Farm has been featured in some articles in
		past issues of the Harlan Record: #5 “Annie”; #7 “Stargazer’s Stone”;
		#16, front page mention plus “Mystery Surrounds Stargazer House” and
		“Concealed Shoe Found in StargazerHouse” on page 7; and #18, lead story. </i></p>
<h3><a name="pleasant"></a>Isaiah Harlan, MD: Early Texas Settler </h3>
<p>By Robert Powers, descendant of Mary Harlan Millerman #2396 </p>
<p>Dr. Isaiah Harlan (#712 in Alpheus Harlan’s History and Genealogy of the Harlan
	Family) was a doctor, planter and stockman. He was born on May 4, 1798, in
	Laurens District, S.C., a seventh generation descendent of Captain William
	Harland. He was only nine years old when his father, Aaron Harlan (#194), died.</p>
<p> Isaiah was quite young when he graduated as a medical doctor. He was a fine
	scholar (called brilliant) and excelled in the sciences and languages, including
	Latin, Greek and Hebrew. He continued his medical practice throughout his
	life, eventually also owning up to ten thousand acres of land in two counties
	in Texas and being a planter and a stockman.</p>
<p> He still lived in South Carolina when he married Nancy Henry (1800 -1852)
	on December 12, 1817. She was born upon a sailing vessel on the Atlantic
	Ocean, en route to America from Ireland. </p>
<p> In 1819, Isaiah, Nancy, and their first-born child, Martha (#2395), left
	South Carolina and moved to Indiana, where several of Isaiah’s older brothers
	had previously settled. They lived in Fayette County, Ind., with his oldest
	brother, Samuel Harlan (#703) until the birth of their second child (Mary
	#2396, listed in the 1820 Federal Census in Fayette County, Ind.). Isaiah
	then moved his family to settle about nine miles from Rockville, Ind., on
	Little Raccoon Creek in Parke County, Ind., where the family lived until 1834. </p>
<p> On August 24, 1829, his family was visited by a cousin, Reason R. Harlan
	(#229), who described Isaiah Harlan as a well-looking man, who then had seven
	children. </p>
<p> At some point, Isaiah had evidently set his eyes on the area then known as
	Tejas, for in 1825 he wrote a letter to Stephen F. Austin (founding father
	of Anglo-Texas) and requested information about obtaining a land grant there.
	Things did not work out immediately, and it was not until the fall of 1834
	that the family arrived in the State of Coahuila, Mexico (which included
	Texas), as family immigrants in Sterling Clack Robertson’s Colony. Robertson
	was a noted land impresario in the Anglo settlement of the Republic of Texas.</p>
<p> Isaiah received a grant for a league of land (4,428 acres) in Sarahville
	de Viesca—then Robertson Colony Headquarters (site of present-day Falls County).
	The land granted to Isaiah was located in what became (in 1837) Robertson County,
	Republic of Texas, and in what (in 1850) became Falls County, Texas (the
	eastern section on which Blue Ridge community is located).</p>
<p> Texas Archive records reveal that Dr. Isaiah Harlan served under Captain
	N. Doyle as a Volunteer Ranger from March 8, 1839, to June 10, 1839, as did
	his brother Joseph Harlan (#711) and Joseph’s eldest son, William Craig Harlan
	(#2386). He was elected to the State Legislature of Texas, but declined to
	serve, not having a taste for public life.</p>
<p> Isaiah Harlan died January 29, 1847 (not 1846 as printed in the1914 Harlan
	genealogy). He passed in his own home in Montgomery County, Texas, (present

	was then called Harlan Burying Ground (now Willis, Texas, Cemetery).</p>
<p> Isaiah’s wife, Nancy, passed on April 10, 1852 (not 1856 as printed in the
	1914 Harlan genealogy). She is buried in the mausoleum beside her husband.

<h3> <a name="hallows"></a>Two Texas History Books Recommended </h3>
<h4>By Tom Powers, brother of Robert Powers, p.4 </h4>
<p> There are hundreds of interesting books about Texas and Texans. However,
	for those who are truly searching for in-depth information on the building
	of thestate over the centuries, in preparation for the 2012 Harlan national
	reunion in San Antonio, Texas, I will recommend the following two books: </p>
<h4> LONE STAR: A History of Texas 
	and Texans, by T.R. Fehrenbach</h4>
<p> This well-researched book is for anyone seriously interested in the people
	who have shaped the Texian character over the centuries, from native tribes,
	through Spanish rule for 300 years, Mexican rule for 15 years, Republic of
	Texas for nine years, U.S. statehood for 15 years, a Confederate state for
	four years, then rejoining the U.S. to become one of the leaders of the Union
	today.</p>
<p> Fehrenbach chronicles the events of the Texas Revolution, Declaration of
	Independence, Battle of the Alamo, Battle of San Jacinto, the years of the
	Republic, and its annexation as a state in 1845. The sagas of cotton and
	oil empires are presented here in vivid language that fills pages with characters
	and epic dynasties. In the last century, and to this day, the global importance
	of oil as an economic resource has changed Texas as radically as the cattle
	culture did 100 years earlier. Lone Star explains and celebrates all the
	regimes, the droughts, the wars, and the boom times, to provide an exciting
	history of the Lone Star State to 2000 A.D. </p>
<h4> The Texas Rangers -A Century of Frontier Defense, 
	by Walter Prescott Webb</h4>
<p> A Century of Frontier Defense, the subtitle of this book, well describes
	the stories told in this excellent book. In the early days of Anglo-Texian
	settlements, there were many men who wanted to live by their own laws, plus
	several tribes of natives that didn’t want white men taking the land they
	called home.</p>
<p>Into this situation rode a small group of men destined to become a model for
	state law enforcement throughout the nation, a group whose fame was to become
	worldwide. They were the Texas Rangers. They knew how to sit on a horse and
	fire a gun. They knew what had to be done, and they simply went out and did
	it.</p>
<p> Patrolling a land almost as large as the Republic of France, the Ranger never
	calculated the dangers except in the most casual way. Who was making the
	trouble? Where? With that meager information, he rode off, a quiet man on
	horseback, heading for trouble spots of his world, working to make a country
	where men could live without fear. </p>
<p> Walter Prescott Webb has told the complete story of this unique law enforcement
	agency. He rode with the Rangers for 14 years when desperate, greedy men
	thought the border between Texas and Mexico was an open gate to bootleggers.
	Anyone interested in law enforcement will like this book. </p>
<p> These two books on Texas history are available at www.amazon.com. They are
	two of my all-time favorites. They may be too long for some readers, but
	they are very good for a serious student of Texas history. </p>

<h3><a name="wright" id="wright"></a>The Rest of the Story: Jacob Wright Harlan, -88 to -02 </h3>
<p> by Steve Harrison (#7447-54) </p>
<p> Jacob Wright Harlan (#2984) was one of the literary members of the Harlan
	family. After making the long and difficult western journey across the plains
	with his uncle, George Harlan, in 1846, he led an eventful life in California.
	His book, <i>California ’46 to ’88</i> was first published in 1888. Jacob reprinted
	it himself in a second edition in 1896. (See information at the end for ordering
	the current reprint of this book.) As you might guess from the title, the
	published account of his life ends in 1888. Not even the Harlan genealogy,
	published in 1914, adds information about his life after 1888.</p>
<p>	In this article, I will fill in some of the events of his life between 1888
	and March 7, 1902, when he died at the age of 73 in San Leandro, Calif.</p>
<p> Jacob’s first wife, Ann Eliza Fowler, died on June 30, 1866. She was buried,
	along with many of Jacob’s family, in the San Lorenzo Cemetery, San Lorenzo,
	Calif. Jacob had six young children to care for but was reportedly depressed
	over the death of his young wife. It was 20 years before he remarried. </p>
<p> On December 25, 1886, he married a Scotch woman named Margaret. She may have
	been a nurse at the Alameda County infirmary (now Fairmont Hospital in San
	Leandro) which he had entered in 1886 when his health began to fail. It is
	likely that he wrote his book at the infirmary.</p>
<p> As a veteran of the Mexican War, Jacob received a pension. His status as
	a veteran also entitled him to live at the Soldiers’ Home in Yountville,
	Napa County, which he did from 1889-1891. However, there was a dramatic and
	sad turn of events at the Home which led to his sudden discharge. </p>
<p>	A San Francisco newspaper reported that the Veterans Home Association had
	decided to give Jacob W. Harlan a hearing on Sunday at the home at Yountville.
	“On Christmas day (1891) Harlan became drunk and noisy, and ended by flourishing
	a bulldog pistol (nowadays known as a Saturday night special). He is likely
	to be expelled from the home.” He was probably not happy about losing his
	residence and quickly applied for readmission. The San Francisco Call reported
	in their issue of January 26, 1892, that the Directors of the Soldiers’ Home
	rejected the petition of Jacob W. Harlan for readmission. “Harlan is the
	old veteran who was discharged last Christmas for drunkenness and threats to
	kill the steward.” </p>
<p> In the preface to the second edition of his book, Jacob has this to say about
	the Soldiers’ Home: “Like many other old men, I have been going on the down
	grade, and my time has been passed partly in the Napa Soldiers’ Home and
	partly in the Infirmary of Alameda County. My stay in the latter institution
	was forced upon me by my loss of health in the former. In the Home my health
	failed me in consequence of damp and unwholesome quarters assigned me and
	bad and tyrannical treatment on the part of the authorities there.</p>
<p> “Old soldiers, as a rule, are far from being saints—in fact, many of us are
	sad sinners, and, in an institution such as this Home, need to be subjected
	to proper discipline fully as much as when in active service in field or
	garrison. Their officers should be gentlemen of character and conduct which
	command respect. While I was in the Home, there was much lack of this. The
	authorities were of lower caste than many of the veteran inmates, and substituted
	coarse severity of demeanor for proper official dignity; in fact, there was
	too much commandant and too little respect for him on the part of the veterans—too
	much dictatorial ordering and too little willing observance of orders—too
	much canteen and too little sobriety. That canteen should not have been there;
	if there now, it should be abolished. It was a standing temptation to indulgence
	in excesses by old men not very well able to withstand temptation of that
	kind. On the whole, my life in the Home was unhappy and unwholesome.” </p>
<p> His stay at the Soldiers’ Home was likely due to a combination of declining
	health and the lack of money. His veteran pension was never more than $12
	per month. He admits in the preface to the second edition of his book that
	he was printing it in the hope that sales would “add something to the little
	pension which a beneficent government assigns to the old Mexican War Veteran.”
	Following his discharge from the Soldiers’ Home, he was once again admitted
	to the Alameda County infirmary on March 10, 1892. He was listed as a widower
	but that is confusing because his second wife, Margaret, didn’t die until
	1895. The director of the infirmary did report later that Jacob’s “habits
	of sobriety were good.” He was discharged in January 1895 but fortunately,
	no gunplay was involved.</p>
<p> A year after the death of his second wife, Margaret, he married for a third
	time. He was then 67 years old. His third wife was Christina (maiden name
	not known), born May 15, 1832, at St. Peter’s on Prince Edward Island, Canada.
	They were married on April 13, 1896, in Oakland, Calif. She died on October
	15, 1903 in San Francisco and was buried at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery
	in Colma, just south of San Francisco.</p>
<p> Jacob himself died on March 7, 1902, in San Leandro, Alameda County. He was
	buried on March 9 in the San Lorenzo Cemetery with many of his family. There
	is no marker on his grave now, but the cemetery has been badly vandalized
	over the years. It was difficult to locate a death notice in the California
	newspapers, so this pioneer was clearly not well-known in California at the
	time. A Livermore newspaper reported, among other things, that, “He was a
	good-natured, social man and his death will be regretted by all who knew
	him.” So quietly ended an eventful life.</p>

<h2><a name="talented"></a>Harlan-Founded Church Celebrates 150 Years</h2>
<h4> By Robert Powers </h4>
<p> The Blue Ridge Baptist Church, founded by Harlan settlers, celebrated its
	150th anniversary on May 3, 2009. The celebration drew more than 325 attendees. </p>
<p> Meeting in a log cabin owned by Silas Harlan (#2399, fifth child of Isaiah &amp; Nancy
	Harlan), the settlers in the Blue Ridge area decided there were enough Baptists
	to found a church, and on August 4, 1859, the band of Christian men and women
	founded the church and adopted the articles of faith.</p>
<p> George Harlan (#2405), younger brother of Silas, donated 28 acres of his
	land in Falls County, Texas, designating that it be used for the church and
	adjoining cemetery, and for school purposes. George’s land was part of the
	land his deceased father had bought from Mexico through land agent Sterling
	Clack Robertson (see story, above). The church was founded while George lived
	in Montgomery Co., Texas.</p>
<p> The church’s origina lfounders included: Brethren A.H. Chamberlain, David
	Barclay, A.S. Trigg, and Sisters C.D. Barclay, Emily Harlan, L.M. Morrel,
	Susan Ross, S.A. Trigg and Tempie G. Chamberlain. Brother Chamberlain, who
	came as a deacon from another Baptist church, was the first deacon at the
	Blue Ridge church. Many of these founders had married into the Harlan family
	or their descendants would do so. </p>
<p> The church held many annual camp meetings and started the all-day May Day
	Singing on the first Sunday in May, which has been held continuously since
	1887. In past years, it was a covered dish dinner with Blue Ridge grazing
	rights, meaning you could graze off any dishes brought by any and all attendees.
	Now the Sunday dinners are usually catered.</p>
<p> The present church building, the congregation’s third, was built in 1908
	and is a three-room structure. It has recently been restored, remodeled and
	updated, the work being led by Harlan descendants Rodger Ross, Henry Thomason
	and Clifford Cobb, Jr. (called Junior). All three are presently Blue Ridge
	community residents. A large metal-covered pavilion for reunions, camp meetings,
	etc., was built also.</p>
<p> The congregation is presently being led by deacons Bill White,Dale Cox and
	Junior Cobb. Rev. Jim Houser brings the message each Sunday, and Sister Dorothy
	Bruchsch plays the piano.</p>
<p> The church and its facilities are used for the Texas Harlans’ annual reunion
	the first Sunday in October and for meetings of the cemetery association.
	Claudia Martin is the reunion president. The cemetery is the resting place
	of mostly Harlan descendants and their spouses. A complete map of all the
	graves has been completed. </p>

<h2><a name="atom"></a>The Harlan Family in South Texas</h2>
<h4> By Ann Harlan Whitis, 
	New Braunfels, Texas</h4>
<p>The small South Texas town of Bishop will celebrate its centennial the weekend
	of May 14 -16, 2010. The Harlan Family will be well represented as one of
	the Pioneer Families. Members of the Harlan Family have lived in Bishop for
	five generations and remain active leaders of the community.</p>
<p> Aaron Spencer Harlan (#6104) and his wife, Lela (Tankersly), moved with their
	five children from Alabama to Mart, Texas, in 1902. Farming wasn’t good,
	so Aaron moved the family to Grandview,Texas. After several years, he heard
	about good, black-land farms for sale in deep South Texas near the King Ranch.
	He moved the family once again, buying 360 acres of farm land and becoming
	one of the pioneer families in Bishop in 1914.</p>
<p> Aaron and Lela raised four boys and one girl, but only one son, Sankie (my
	grandfather), continued on the family farm and raised his family in Bishop.
	All of Aaron and Lela’s children attended college and pursued careers, as
	college professors, a lawyer, bankers, and a farmer. Three of the sons (Bill,
	Pierce, and Sankie) bought the Bishop First State Bank. In 1934, Bill thwarted
	an attempted holdup of the bank when he shot first! The robbers were later
	caught and sent to the penitentiary.</p>
<p> Sankie was the baby of the family. He attended Baylor University, then returned
	to the family farm and married the prettiest girl in town, Lottie Mayo, in
	1925. Sankie and Lottie had three sons and one daughter. All three sons lived
	in Bishop and were partners in Harlan Farms. Over the years, Harlan Farms
	expanded, growing cotton, milo, and corn. The legacy continues as the oldest
	Sankie Harlan grandson, Steve, still farms the family land.</p>
<p> Sankie’s athletic talent was another claim to fame. He was the first student
	from Bishop ever to go to State in track. (The running gene is strong in
	the Harlan family;	Sankie’s great-grandson, John Rainbolt, ran track for
	the University of Texas a few years ago.) Sankie was also one of the first football
	players for the Baylor Bears.</p>
<p> Sankie and Lottie Harlan instilled in their family a strong sense of pride
	in country, community, and family. Members of the Harlan family have been
	active in Bishop’s school, civic, religious, and social organizations. The
	Harlan Family Crest will be proudly displayed at Bishop’s Centennial Celebration.</p>

<h2><a name="enigma"></a>From Harlan to Harland: A Name Change Story</h2>
<h4>Editor’s Note: Spelling variations add to the genealogist’s challenge, as
	recounted by Lottie Harland Underwood, Jacksonville, FL:</h4>
<blockquote>
	<p> “My grandfather John Luther Harlan left the family when my father, Louis,
		was very young. His surname had no ‘d.’ My uncle William had to change his
		name when he entered the military in the early ’50s, due to other Harlans
		in there. He added a ‘d’ to the end of his surname, and his mother and some
		siblings also did. My dad’s birth and school records do not have a ‘d,’ but
		that’s the way we spell it. Dad’s siblings John, Opal, and Pearl never added
		the ‘d.’ </p>
	<p> “My dad and his brother John were albinos and received disability. Dad spelled
		his name with a ‘d’ when that began, and John didn’t. They had to keep their
		names that way to draw their benefits. That story was told, and I found it
		was true. My great-grandfather Zephania(h) spelled his name three different
		ways: Harlin, Harlan, and Harland.</p>
	<p> “I have hit many brick walls with this research until I almost gave up. I
		keep putting a few more pieces together little by little and can’t seem to
		stop.... You never know who I might find to be related.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> A story about Lottie’s father, written by Cecil Guiles, appeared in the April
	1959 issue of The Lighted Pathway, a newsletter formerly published by the
	Church of God Publishing House, Cleveland, Tenn. The article tells about
	Louis Harland’s generous nature. As a youngster, he mowed lawns and gave
	money to the church. In 1956, he gave the DeKalb, Ill., Church of God an
	organ and amplifier, and two years later, he donated a piano. He bought furnishings
	for the parsonage and solicited local businesses for funds when the church
	needed renovation. He worked as the church janitor for free. As Guiles wrote,“These
	are just a few of the many things that Louis does. ... He is loved by all
	who know him.” </p>
<h2><a name="gcorner"></a>GENEALOGY CORNER</h2>
<p>Everyone hits a brick wall in genealogy, where the birth and death records
	just aren’t easy to find. In that case, try some different records. One good
	source to try: historic land records. Deeds often contain information on who
	sold what to whom; who inherited what from whom; or how some land was divided
	among a family. Historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting
	information, such as co-ownership. Most archives have land records, and many
	have an online way to search the index and then order a copy of the record you
	want for a small fee. </p>
<p> Most beginning genealogists underestimate the importance of using land records
	to pin persons to specific locales. In the South, which has far fewer vital
	records than New England, the land records are even more crucial to genealogical
	success. </p>
<p> Land records provide two types of important evidence for the genealogist.
	First, they often state kinship ties, especially when a group of heirs jointly
	sells some inherited land. Second, they place individuals in a specific time
	and place, allowing the researcher to sort people and families into neighborhoods
	and closely related groups. By locating people with reference to creeks and
	other natural features, the deeds, land grants, and land tax lists help distinguish
	one John Harlan, son of James, from another John Harlan in the same county. </p>
<p> Prior to the Civil War, most free adult males owned land; so if the land
	records of an area have survived but do not mention your ancestor, you should
	reevaluate the assumption that he or she lived in the area. Deeds form the
	bulk and backbone of American land records. They are fairly uniform in format
	and content, can normally be located in routinely predictable jurisdictions—usually
	the county—and generally present few difficulties for the average researcher.
	The term “deed” can be used broadly to mean a legal document of transfer,
	bargain, or contract, or narrowly for a warranty deed by which the seller
	warrants (guarantees) the title to the land being sold. Deed books contain
	many types of title conveyances and contracts: deeds in fee simple granting
	absolute ownership, mortgages transferring property rights as security for a
	debt, dower releases waiving a wife’s rights, quitclaim deeds releasing whatever
	title or right is held whether valid or not, deeds of gift transferring land
	without a reciprocal consideration except perhaps “love and affection,” powers
	of attorney appointing legal agents, marriage property settlements between spouses
	either before or after the marriage, bills of sale transferring property that
	is usually not land, and various forms of contracts, such as leases, partnerships,
	indenture papers, and other performance bonds. These last four were not ordinarily
	recorded, though probate bonds were common in probate volumes. </p>
