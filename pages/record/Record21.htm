<p align=left><b><a name="national reunion"></a>National Reunion&#8212;Back to Where 

Our Family Story Began By C. J. King</b></p>

<p align=left>Nearly 400 attended the National Harlan Family Reunion in 

Wilmington, Del., June 27-30, centered at the Doubletree Hotel. The hours were 

packed with activities celebrating our heritage and sharing fellowship and 

fun.</p>

<p align=left>The events started with registration Thursday afternoon, followed 

by a reception at the hotel that evening. We welcomed familiar faces and met new 

cousins, filled up on a wonderful buffet of appetizers, and studied family 

history and previous reunion displays set up around the room. </p>

    <td valign=top width="44%">

      <p align=left>Tours of Harlan family historical sites were offered 

      throughout the morning and afternoon on Friday and Saturday. The tours 

      lasted about three hours each and included stops at:<br>&#8226; Centre, London 

      Grove, and Old Kennett Meeting Houses; <br>&#8226; the Log House, built in 1727 

      by Joshua Harlan (#13), son of George (#3), part of a building that is now 

      a bed and breakfast (for more information, see issues No. 7 and 14 of The 

      Harlan Record);<br>&#8226; the stone house built by #4 Michael Harlan&#8217;s son, 

      George (#14), and occupied by Harlan descendants until 1950 (see issues 

      No. 5, 16, 19), now the home to veterinarian and &#8220;adopted&#8221; Harlan family 

      member Kate Roby, who has generously given tours to many Harlans over the 

      years;<br>&#8226; the Stargazer Stone (issues # 7, 18) near Roby&#8217;s house that 

      British astronomers Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon used to help plot the 

      Mason-Dixon line; <br>&#8226; and other significant sites.</p>

      <p align=left>Thanks to all of our guides, arranged for by Mary Harlan 

      Murphy, one of the reunion organizers.</p></td>

<p align=left>Many members of the group also went to the family picnic at the 

Brandywine Picnic Park, which lasted from late morning until late afternoon 

Friday and included all the food we could eat and activities: train rides; a 

dunk tank; softball, volleyball and basketball; a petting zoo; a rock climbing 

wall; balloon toss; dance contests; swimming and tubing. We also had a 

sing-a-long led by our musical cousin, Becky Gaskill, of Sellersburg, Ind., 

accompanied by Mary Ellen Black, of Randolph, Vt. Of course, we sang Becky&#8217;s 

song, &#8220;A Family of Friends,&#8221; written by her for her mother, but adopted as our 

organization&#8217;s theme song. We also sang our way through a list of old-time 

favorites.</p>

<p align=left>On Saturday, several workshops taught us about: <br>&#8226; &#8220;How Old Is 

That Photograph?&#8221; (clues to help figure out the date of old photographs), led by 

Pam Powell, Chester County Historical Society; <br>&#8226; &#8220;Fashionable Dress of the 

Early 19th Century&#8212;A Brief View of Costuming From Outside In&#8221;&#8212;this G-rated 

undressing act, led by Harlan cousin Carol Meeks, of the Conner Prairie Living 

History Museum, near Indianapolis, Ind., showed us the fashions, from what a 

proper lady would have worn to go calling, down to her underwear and 

sleepwear;<br>&#8226; &#8220;Quaker heritage of Chester County,&#8221; led by Paul Rodebaugh, West 

Chester Historic and Architecture Review Board;<br>&#8226; &#8220;The Harlan-Lincoln Women,&#8221; 

led by C.J. King, of Jamaica, Vt., writer, teacher and Harlan Family Board 

member;<br>&#8226; &#8220;Along the Brandywine River,&#8221; a historical overview of the 

settlements there, led by Bruce Mowday, curator of the Brandywine Battlefield 

State Park and husband of Katherine Harlan; <br>&#8226; and about how to use Alpheus 

Harlan&#8217;s History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family to trace family lines from 

the first American settlers to around 1900 (led by family members Esther Harlan 

Wells, Junior Harlan, Ruth Gove, and C.J. King).<br><br>At a family banquet 

Saturday night, plaques of appreciation were presented to family members who 

have faithfully served the Harlan Family in various ways and for extended 

periods of time, including Martha and Elgene Smith, Ridge Harlan, Jim and Sue 

Harlan, Becky Gaskill, John R. Harlan, Peggy Harlan Talley and Lowell B. Harlan. 

</p>

<p align=left>Thanks were also extended to Larry Harlan, Pam Ellingson, and 

Jonathan Harlan for their work on the Harlan Web site; to Judi and Gene Graber 

for maintaining the mailing list; to Esther Harlan Wells for collecting 

genealogy updates; to Dorothy Harlan Sperry for producing the family cookbook; 

and to Kate Roby for her continued hospitality while giving tours of her 

home.</p>

<p align=left>The highlight of the evening was the presentation of Dan Harlan&#8217;s 

play, &#8220;Some Uncommon Kin: A Celebration of Harlan Family Diversity,&#8221; which told 

about several courageous and unusual Harlans. Nearly three dozen cousins 

participated in the production, some acting out scenes on stage, others reading 

from backstage, or singing choruses between scenes. The stories included: <br>&#8226; 

Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan&#8217;s fight against Jim Crow laws 

(throughout his term, he gained the nickname &#8220;The Great Dissenter&#8221;);<br>&#8226; George 

and Elizabeth Harlan&#8217;s trek from Michigan to California (1845-46); <br>&#8226; 

Philadelphian Josiah Harlan&#8217;s travels in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan from 

1923 to 1842;<br>&#8226; David Harlan&#8217;s travels under the command of Lieutenant 

Charles Wilkes, on the U.S. Navy sloop Peacock, including a trip to Antarctica 

(1838-1840);<br>&#8226; and Mary Harlan Lincoln&#8217;s experiences as friend of the 

President during the Civil War and as his daughter-in-law after his death.</p>

<p align=left>Sunday morning, some cousins attended a Quaker-style silent 

meditation service at the Old Kennett Meeting House, where many Harlan ancestors 

are buried.<br><br>All too quickly, it was time for the final brunch and the 

family business meeting Sunday morning, then time to say good-bye to each other 

and head home, our heads and hearts full of special memories, new knowledge, and 

renewed pride in the kinds of people we get to call our kin.</p>

    <td valign=top width="55%">

      <p>Perhaps the youngest Harlan to attend this reunion was three-month-old 

      Nicholas Harlan Shavel, son of Becky and Scott Shavel, and grandson of Bob 

      and Cindy Harlan, all of Greensburg, Pa. &#8220;Pennsylvania Bob&#8221; (a nickname 

      we&#8217;ve adopted to distinguish him from the Bob who is president of our 

      organization) and Mary Harlan Murphy, of Wayne, Pa., were the reunion&#8217;s 

      two coordinators.</p>

      <p>One of the younger attendees at the last reunion (1997, Mt. Pleasant, 

      Iowa) was Alexandra Harlan, daughter of Jonathan and Fiona, of Jackson, 

      Tenn. Alexandra was four at the time, and while she probably doesn&#8217;t 

      remember much of that reunion, this time she was really impressed. With a 

      note of wonder in her voice, she was overheard pointing at the reception 

      room Thursday night and asking one cousin, &#8220;Do you know that all those 

      people in there are my family?&#8221;</p>

      <p>Alexandra&#8217;s younger brother, Niall, turned eight that Thursday, and he 

      received a rousing chorus of &#8220;Happy Birthday&#8221; from the group during the 

      opening reception. Jonathan Harlan is the host of our family&#8217;s Web 

      site.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p align=left>Next March, the Harlan Family board members will meet, and among 

the other business to discuss will be preliminary plans for our next reunion, to 

be held out West in 2007. So mark your calendars and plan to join us! </p>

      its roots in England with an exceptional tour. </p>

      <p>Naturally the highlight of the trip will be visiting the northern 

      seacoast area of Monkwearmouth, where our common ancestor was baptized in 

      St. Peter&#8217;s Church. As with earlier trips, we will arrive there with a 

      lump in our throats and tears in our eyes just to be there. </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>But before and after that, we will travel through England&#8217;s Cotswolds 

      and Lakes, joyful to be in our homeland and sharing these experiences with 

      some newfound and other long-known cousins. Join us on this sentimental

  <div align=left>Accommodations will be in country and city hotels. Come along 

  for another truly unforgettable trip. Included in the tour are trips 

  to:<br><br>&#8226; mysterious Stonehenge on the Salisbury Plain, dating from the 

  late Stone and early Bronze Age (about 3000-1000 BC); <br><br>&#8226; the beautiful 

  city of Bath, with its great Roman temple and bathing complex (built almost 

  2000 years ago) and No. 1 Royal Crescent (considered one of the finest 

  achievements of urban 18th century architecture);<br><br>&#8226; Woodstock and 

  Blenheim Palace (home of the 11th Duke of Marlborough and birthplace of Sir 

  Winston Churchill); to Banbury for a visit to Broughton Castle, home of Lord 

  &amp; Lady Say and Sele and their family. The original medieval Manor House, 

  much of which emains today, was built in 1300 by Sir John de Broughton and 

  stands on an island site surrounded by a three-acre moat. This castle was used 

  as the home of the heroine in the recent film Shakespeare in Love;<br><br>&#8226; 

  Chipping Campden, a charming Cotswolds wool town; to Cots-wolds country market 

  day sites; to the Guildhall of Handicraft (established in 1888 by C. R. 

  Ashbee, now the home of third generation silversmith David Hart and his 

  workshop, this stop includes a demonstration on how they make their silverware 

  using traditional methods); <br><br>&#8226; Coventry Cathedral and perhaps a visit 

  to the mother plant of Jaguar Daimler Motor Car;<br><br>&#8226; York and a visit to 

  Sutton Park, the site of the Harland home site described in Alpheus Harlan&#8217;s 

  History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family (page 968). The Yorkshire house 

  there today is the home of Sir Reginald and Lady Sheffield. Here we will see a 

  rich collection of 18th century furniture, paintings and porcelain. Then we 

  cross the lane to the nearby parish church which contains the remains of 

  several generations of Harlands from Sutton Hall;<br><br>&#8226; James Herriott 

  sites (author of All Creatures Great &amp; Small);<br><br>&#8226; Durham&#8217;s outdoor 

  market and Durham Cathedral, the burial place of St. Cuthbert and the 

  Venerable Bede, hopefully in time for evensong at 5:30. (Durham Cathedral is 

  the castle in the recent movie Elizabeth.);<br><br>&#8226; Sunday Eucharist at our 

  family church site, St. Peter&#8217;s in Monkwearmouth, followed by a guided tour 

  and coffee, plus a trip to the Moors and Harlan site nearby;<br><br>&#8226; the 

  beautiful Lake District , with a morning cruise on Lake Windermere;<br><br>&#8226; 

  Liverpool, most likely departure site of the Harlans for the first leg of 

  their journey to America, by way of Ireland, including a visit to the Maritime 

  Museum and the Cathedral, with their unique collection of church

<p><b><a name=booklets></a>Updated Genealogy Booklets </b></p>

<p>Alpheus Harlan&#8217;s book of the History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family in 

America, published in 1914, had its beginning in the Fall of 1881 when he 

visited some of his father&#8217;s cousins in order to learn from them something of 

the life and history of his great-grandfather Harlan. His visit began his 

journey to set down in permanent form all that could be learned concerning the 

family.</p>

<p>The effort to continue recording the family history was revitalized at the 

Harlan Family Tricentennial, held in Wilmington, Del., in 1987. As a result of 

this effort the &#8220;Texas Red Books&#8221; were printed in 1990 by Joydelle Wolfram on 

the descendants of Aaron (#194) and Elizabeth (Stuart) Harlan, Samuel Harlan 

(#195), and Valentine Harlan (#200).</p>

<p>Esther Harlan Wells began her efforts to continue gathering Harlan family 

data in 1998 and is putting it on a database. </p>

<p>Genealogy booklets from this data have been created, displayed, and are now 

placed at Chester County Historical Society. These booklets are only available 

for viewing, in person, at Chester County Historical Society.</p>

<p>Esther Harlan Wells will continue to update the database with additional 

family information and will periodically create booklets and forward them to the 

Chester County Historical Society. </p>

<p>A list of <a href="http://www.harlanfamily.org/data.htm">updated lines</a> 

will soon be listed on the Harlan Web site. Corrections or additions to Alpheus 

Harlan&#8217;s book are noted by an asterisk. To obtain more information regarding the 

details of the updated lines and contributor contact, e-mail Esther Harlan Wells 

at: <a href="mailto:bewell123@att.net">bewell123@att.net</a> </p>

<p>Thanks to all contributors for sharing their data in an effort to continue 

recording the Harlan Family History that Alpheus Harlan began.</p>

<p><b><a name=Afghanistan></a>In 1830&#8212;A Harlan in Afghanistan</b><br>By Harry V. 

Harlan<br>New Orleans, La.</p>

<p>I recently started reading a book entitled Central Asia, the Personal 

Narrative of General Josiah Harlan (1823-1841). General Harlan (#1200) tells of 

his adventures in Afghanistan during that period. The book was published in 1939 

by Luzac &amp; Co. of London. </p>

<p>The book opens with the words, &#8220;Josiah Harlan was beyond doubt a unique 

figure in the history of Central Asia. He was in a sense a pioneer: the first 

American to operate in that part of the world.&#8221; Then, as now, for the foreigner 

in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>The book continues: &#8220;In 1823, young Josiah Harlan journeyed to the East 

Indies. There he found hostilities in progress and doctors much in demand. 

Although there is no record that Harlan ever studied medicine, he entered the 

service of the East India Company as an officiating assistant surgeon and was 

attached to Colonel George Pollock&#8217;s Bengal Artillery during the First Burmese 

War. </p>

<p>&#8220;Harlan&#8217;s brother, Richard (1796-1843, #1199), was a doctor and subsequently 

attained some degree of fame as a naturalist. Josiah may have taken a few of his 

brother&#8217;s medical books with him and then decided to use their contents in 

treating persons other than himself. Certainly young Josiah&#8217;s later career 

causes this hypothesis to seem both reasonable and probable. It is quite in 

keeping with his character.&#8221; </p>

<p>Later it says, &#8220;Harlan then entered the service of Maharajah Ranjit Singh, 

sovereign of the Punjab. During the ensuing seven years Harlan attained high 

favour at the Court of Lahore and became governor, successively, of the 

provinces of Jesraota, Noorpore and Guzerath.&#8221; Although he was born a Quaker and 

had no formal military training, he became a general and led various detachments 

in the ensuing wars of that period. </p>

<p>The book continues: &#8220;Angered at some action of the Punjab monarch, Harlan 

left the Court of Lahore. Journeying to Kabul, he urged the mortal enemy of his 

former master to further hostilities. Becoming aide-de-camp to Dost Mohammed 

Khan and the general of regular troops of the Afghan army, he instructed the 

troops in the European military tactics. So effectively did Harlan do his work, 

aided by an Englishman named Campbell, that the Afghan troops ... defeated the 

Sikh army ... in the battle of Jamrud (April, 1837).<br><br>&#8220;Wrote Harlan, &#8216;The 

proud King of Lahore quailed upon his threatened throne, as he exclaimed with 

terror and approaching despair, &#8220;Harlan has avenged himself, this is all his 

work.&#8221; &#8217; &#8221; (page 13). </p>

<p>The book is filled with extraordinary detail about the people, places and 

events of Afghanistan in the 1830s. It has been of great interest to me, 

considering the contemporary events in Afghanistan and lets us know that not 

much has changed in that country in the last 170 years. More than ever, the 

people of Afghanistan need our help.</p>

<p>In passing, I will note that my father, Jack R. Harlan, and his brother, 

Wilbur V. Harlan, both spent some time in Afghanistan in their work. Their 

father, Harry V. Harlan (#9778), for whom I am named, never visited Afghanistan 

but did go to several of the surrounding areas, including Pakistan, India and 

Kashmir. He was a plant explorer whose primary interest was barley, but he was 

apt to collect anything of interest.</p>

<p>Wilbur took a job teaching English at an English speaking school in Kabul in 

1938. He went there because as an agriculture instructor at George Washington 

University, in Washington D.C., he was not being paid very well (it was the 

height of the Great Depression), and someone in Afghanistan contacted his 

professor, a Dr. Griggs, through the Turkish embassy, looking for teachers. My 

uncle signed up. He tells me that in those days Afghanistan was a pretty 

primitive place. Most of the houses in Kabul were of adobe construction, and the 

women in the cities were entirely covered, whereas not as much so in the 

countryside. </p>

<p>Note from Richard Harlan Moore: Josiah Harlan is featured on the cover story 

on a recent issue of SPAN, a magazine published by the U.S. Embassy in India. It 

is available online at: <a

<p><b><a name=cd></a>&#8220;Family of Friends&#8221; on New CD</b><br><br>In 1987 the 

talented vocalist and songwriter, Rebecca Gaskill, wrote the hauntingly 

beautiful song, A Family of Friends, as a tribute to her mother, Mary Harlan 

Gaskill, and to her Quaker Harlan heritage. It became the cherished theme song 

of The Harlan Family in America and has been sung at every major gathering since 

that time. The title of the song was also chosen as the Harlan slogan and is 

part of the new Harlan logo. </p>

<p>Now Rebecca is proud to announce that a new arrangement of the song is 

included in her latest album, Lifted in Love. This inspirational album contains 

more of Becky&#8217;s musical compositions, a few old favorites with a different 

twist, and creations by two other writers/composers. </p>

<p>Becky&#8217;s voice and heartfelt musical interpretations have wowed audiences all 

around the country. Everyone who has listened to this album says it is truly 

wonderful. If you like having a time of peaceful prayer and meditation, the 

three most soothing songs (lasting about 27 minutes) are conveniently placed at 

the end so as to not interrupt your quiet time by having to turn off the 

CD/cassette player at its completion. The album itself is about 60 minutes 

long.</p>

<p>Lifted in Love can be purchased for $15 per CD/$10 per cassette. Shipping and 

handling costs: $3 for 1-2 items and $.50 for each additional item. Send orders, 

plus check or money order, to: Rebecca Gaskill, 8505 Starview Ct., Sellersburg, 

Ind. 47172.</p>

<p>Becky also has individual cassettes and sheet music of A Family of Friends as 

well as a successful children&#8217;s album, Believing in Yourself, released by Unity 

School of Christianity. For questions, contact Becky at (812) 246-8286 or <a

<p><a name=echoes></a><b>Echoes of Andersonville, Part Two</b><br><br>By Edward 

Harlan Wynn, Contributing Editor</p>

<p>(Continuation of an article published in the <a 

href="http://www.harlanfamily.org/record/record20.htm">Spring, 2002, Harlan 

Record</a>)<br><br>In Part One, I chronicled the deaths in Andersonville of 

Wilbur Fisk Massey (#2712) and James C. Harlan (#6959). Unfortunately Wilbur and 

James were not the only members of the Harlan family to suffer and die at 

Andersonville.</p>

<p>Conditions at the Confederate Prison Camp at Andersonville were worse than at 

any other war prison, North or South. The Georgia heat, along with disease, 

filth, exposure, and lack of adequate medical care, took a fearful toll. </p>

<p>In September, 1864, General William T. Sherman&#8217;s Union Army captured Atlanta 

and brought its cavalry within reach of Andersonville. The Confederacy relocated 

surviving prisoners to other camps, and Camp Sumter operated as a smaller 

facility for the rest of the war. But the summer had taken a terrible toll: of 

the 45,000 Union soldiers confined at Camp Sumter, 13,000 died, including 

several Harlan men.</p>

<p>Isaac Richards Brinton (#4283), the second of four children of Ann Richards 

(#1477) and Caleb Brinton, of Lancaster County, Pa., enlisted as a Private in 

Company D, 1st Independent Battalion, 157th Pennsylvania Infantry on October 22, 

1862, at Lancaster, Pa.</p>

<p>He was mustered into the Army on October 24 in Philadelphia. He was made a 

Corporal on March 1, 1863, at which time he was reported &#8220;sick in hospital at 

Cliffton Barracks, Washington, D.C.&#8221; He remained sick through August of that 

year. On December 1, 1863, he was reduced in rank to Private and was reportedly 

on daily duty.</p>

<p>In the Company D Muster Roll for March/April 1864 he was &#8220;dropped as a 

deserter, but supposed to have been captured April 16, 1864.&#8221; Isaac had indeed 

been captured. His service records reveal that he died on July 17, 1864, of 

dysentery, as a Confederate prisoner at Andersonville. He is buried in grave 

#3442 at the Andersonville National Cemetery.</p>

<p>Newton Bray (#6868), the son of Henry Bray and Pamela Harlan (#2731) of 

Monroe County, Ky., was the tenth of 12 children. The Harlan book reports that 

he died &#8220;while in the Union Army in May 1863 at Andersonville at the age of 

twenty.&#8221; He was unmarried at the time of his death. The compiler has been unable 

to locate any records of Newton&#8217;s military service through a National Archive 

search. The Harlan book was no doubt in error as to the year of his death, since 

Andersonville Prison did not exist in May of 1863. More likely, he died in May 

of 1864. Despite this discrepancy concerning Newton Bray, this author feels that 

he deserves his place among the Harlan men who suffered and died at 

Andersonville. </p>

<p>A search of the Andersonville records has revealed two additional Harlan men. 

To date, I have not connected them to anyone in the Harlan book. </p>

<p>Harvey Harlan was a Wagoner in Company I of the 13th Kentucky Infantry. He 

enlisted on October 13, 1861, and was mustered into his unit on December 31, 

1861, at Camp Hobson, Ky. Harvey was one of two men from his regiment to die at 

Andersonville. Andersonville records list his date of death as April 6, 1864, 

while Kentucky records list his date of death as March 24, 1864.</p>

<p>The last Harlan identified thus far as being held at Andersonville was M. 

Harlan, a Private in Company H of the 1st Michigan Cavalry. His Andersonville 

records indicate he was a member of Squad #5 and that he was exchanged on April 

15, 1865, just six days after General Robert E. Lee&#8217;s surrender at Appomattox. 

Thus, &#8220;M&#8221; became the only known Harlan to survive the horrors of Andersonville. 

</p>

<p>I have requested the service and pension records of Harvey Harlan and M. 

Harlan from the National Archives but had not received them at the time of this 

writing. Hopefully these records will enable us to establish their links to the 

family.</p>

<p>I am certain that I will uncover more &#8220;cousins&#8221; held in the Confederate 

prison at Andersonville. It appears that over 600 men with the Harlan(d) 

<br>surname served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and more than 200 

served in Confederate Grey. </p>

      <p><b><a name=essays></a>Winning Essays &#8212; <br>&#8220;What the Harlan Family 

      Means to Me&#8221;</b></p>

      <p>Prior to the 2002 Harlan reunion, young people were invited to enter an 

      essay contest. A tie was declared, and both Caitlin Brick and Christine 

      Lundgren were awarded $100 bonds. </p>

      <p><b>Being a Harlan Means a Lot to Me<br>By Christine Lundgren, age 

      12<br>Stanton, Iowa</b></p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Being a Harlan means a lot to me. I&#8217;m very proud of my ancestors and of 

      the Harlans of today. This gives me self-respect and honor.</p>

      <p>Harriet Harlan, my great aunt, has traveled all over and enjoys telling 

      all of us about it. She&#8217;s very interesting to listen to. She also enjoys 

      sharing things with her family that she&#8217;s found on her trips. Louis 

      Harlan, my great uncle, has published many books. He&#8217;s a very accomplished 

      writer.</p>

      <p>Holly Harlan, my aunt, has endured great hardship. She is raising her 

      daughter, Emily, by herself. She&#8217;s also survived a terrible car 

      accident.</p>

      <p>Another aunt, Joanne Harlan Ewing, is exceptional because she helps 

      people in her community. She also shares her love for books with 

      children.</p>

      <p>Gerry Harlan Lundgren, my mother, has done a great job at raising me. 

      She&#8217;s very devoted to me. She attends all of my activities that she 

      can.</p>

      <p>Some of the Harlans of the past also accomplished great things. Alpheus 

      Harlan was very extraordinary. He compiled a book called The History and 

      Genealogy of the Harlan Family. He was able to write this book without a 

      computer in 1881.</p>

      <p>Esther Harlan DeArmoun traveled from Ohio to Iowa in 1855. It was 

      rough, and her sister even died along the way. Esther was strong enough to 

      make it all the way. This is what being a Harlan means to me, having 

      ancestors that have made great accomplishments in the past and continue to 

      do so.</p></td>

      <p><b><i>Essay Contest Winners Caitlin Brick &amp; Christine 

      Lundgren</i></b></p>

      <p><b>What the Harlan Family Means to Me<br>By Caitlin Brick, age 

      12<br>Overland Park, Kansas</b></p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Memories, Happiness, Friends, and Family &shy; they come to mind when I 

      think of the Harlan Family. Everyone (in the family at least) all over the 

      United States comes together to acquaint and re-acquaint with everybody 

      else. To talk, play and make new friends.</p>

      <p>Of course we owe this all to George and Michael Harlan. I never knew 

      the men, considering I have only been alive for twelve years, but I know 

      enough that they started all of us. They are the foundation of the Harlan 

      family in America. They were the ones who began the spread of the Harlan 

      family throughout the United States. </p>

      <p>Most importantly they helped establish the Quaker religion in parts of 

      Delaware and Pennsylvania. Thanks to George and Michael Harlan, in some 

      way or another we are connected to several different generations of 

      people.</p>

      <p>Coming to a huge family reunion is a lot of fun, because there is 

      someone there with a smile on his or her face ready to greet you. The only 

      problem is with so many relatives, I can&#8217;t meet all of them 

personally.</p>

      <p>At family reunions, I love learning about the family and surroundings. 

      Just spending time and listening in a room full of adults is fun. Learning 

      about the life and history of the Harlans is a great pleasure, because it 

      will stay in my mind. No matter what happens it will be with me 

      forever.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

      <p align=left><i>September 2, 2002<br><br>Dear Harlan Family:<br><br>On 

      behalf of the Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation Committee at Iowa Wesleyan 

      College, I sincerely thank the Harlan Family in America for your 

      contribution of $750.00.<br><br>You should have heard my shout for joy 

      when I opened the envelope! Your generous support is very much appreciated 

      and a great shot in the arm.<br></i></p>

      <p align=left><i>This summer, the Iowa Wesleyan College administration has 

      committed to projects totaling $23,000 which were recommended by a 

      historical architect to stabilize the Harlan-Lincoln House property. In 

      addition, we will be using our restricted account funds to install a new 

      heating, air conditioning, and ventilation system to provide climate 

      control, and we will install a security system to protect against theft, 

      fire, and fluctuating temperature. Our committee is dedicated to 

      preserving our part of the Harlan Family&#8217;s history here in Mount Pleasant. 

      We are excited about the possibilities for the Harlan-Lincoln House, and 

      we are working diligently to develop them. <br><br>Please convey our 

      gratitude to the other members of the Harlan Family Board and to your 

      membership. I hope many of you will again visit us and will note our 

      progress.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Lynn Ellsworth, archivist <br>Iowa

      <p align=left><a name=remembering></a><b>Excerpts from REMEMBERING 

      INDEPENDENCE DAY</b><br>Submitted by Earl C. Harlan, Courtesy of his 

      Masonic Lodge</p>

      <p align=left>Have you ever wondered what happened to the 56 men who 

      signed the Declaration of Independence?<br>&#8226; Five signers were captured by 

      the British as traitors and tortured before they died.<br>&#8226; Twelve had 

      their homes ransacked and burned.<br>&#8226; Two lost their sons serving in the 

      Revolutionary Army; another had two sons captured.<br>&#8226; Nine of the 56 

      fought and died from wounds or hardships of the Revolutionary War.</p>

      <p align=left>They signed and pledged their lives, their fortunes and 

      their sacred honor.<br></p>

      <p align=left>Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists. Eleven were merchants, 

      nine were farmers and large plantation owners&#8212;men of means, well educated. 

      But they signed the Declaration of Independence, knowing full well that 

      the penalty would be death if they were captured. </p></td>

<p align=left>Carter Braxton of Virginia, a wealthy planter and trader, saw his 

ships swept from the seas by the British Navy. He sold his home and properties 

to pay his debts and died in rags. <br><br>Thomas McKeam was so hounded by the 

British that he was forced to move his family almost constantly. He served in 

the congress without pay, and his family was kept in hiding. His possessions 

were taken from him, and poverty was his reward.</p>

<p align=left>Frances Lewis had his home and properties destroyed. The enemy 

jailed his wife, and she died in a few months.</p>

<p align=left>John Hart was driven from his wife&#8217;s bedside as she was dying. 

Their 13 children fled for their lives. His fields and his gristmill were laid 

to waste. For more than a year he lived in forests and caves, returning home to 

find his wife dead and his children vanished. A few weeks later he died from 

exhaustion and a broken heart.</p>

<p align=left>Norris and Livingston suffered similar fates. Such were the 

stories and sacrifices of the American Revolution. These were not wild-eyed, 

rabble-rousing ruffians. They were soft spoken men of means and education. They 

had security, but they valued liberty more.</p>

<p align=left>They gave you and me a free and independent America. The history 

books never told you a lot about what happened in the Revolutionary War. We 

didn&#8217;t fight just the British. We were British subjects at that time, and we 

fought our own government!</p>

<p align=left>Some of us take these liberties so much for granted, but we 

shouldn&#8217;t. So take a few minutes and silently thank these patriots. It&#8217;s not 

much to ask for the price they paid.</p>

<p align=left>Remember: Freedom is never free!</p></div>
