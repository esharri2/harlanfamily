            />Those of us who read this newsletter and who use The Harlan Family
            in America association to help us with family history research
            proudly call each other &ldquo;cousin.&rdquo; Our family lines may
            be very distant, but we know we have at least the main root in
            common. Though we might not have known each other through the
            everyday circumstances of our lives, we have come to feel like
            family because The Harlan Family in America association has brought
            us together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of us have helped other Harlans by sharing a piece of
            information that fits their genealogical puzzle, or by teaching
            someone how to use Alpheus Harlan&rsquo;s book. But there are a few
            cousins who have impacted the whole lot of us in even more profound
            ways than that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alpheus Harlan comes to mind. He spent over two decades diligently
            collecting information on family lines, and the result is the book
            that, arguably, many of us could not do without. [We are collecting
            stories from those who have copies from the book&rsquo;s original
            printing &hellip; see below.]
          </p>
          <p>
            Daniel Dunaway Harlan is another cousin who has been essential to
            our community. When Dan realized that the 300th anniversary of the
            Harlans arriving in America was approaching, he thought there should
            be a national reunion, and he didn&rsquo;t just say, &ldquo;Someone
            else should do it.&rdquo; He undertook the project himself and got
            the ball rolling. It&rsquo;s not an exaggeration to say that The
            Harlan Family in America association would not exist today without
            his efforts. Dan served as president of the Harlan association from
            1997 to 1999.
          </p>
          <p>
            We all have stories to tell about how we came to be interested in
            the family history quest. We asked Dan to tell us his story, as a
            way to pay him special tribute, and here is what he wrote:
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I have been a student of history since my introduction to the
            subject in the fifth grade. But my special interest in family
            history began some fifteen years later in the majestic Main Reading
            Room of the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C., where I was
            working on a paper for a course at The American University.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I digressed from my AU assignment to explore a volume I found
            there, Alpheus Harlan&rsquo;s
            <i>History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family in America.</i> In
            1951, my father, living in Ohio, and slightly acquainted with
            59-year-old William and 71-year-old Maude Harlan, the unmarried son
            and daughter of the late Alpheus, drove to their New Burlington,
            Ohio, home to acquire a copy of this book. Later, Dad and his older
            brother, Harry, supported local Harlan reunions in the Zanesville,
            Ohio, area by attending with family members of their five other
            siblings, including me. It gave Mary Ann an opportunity to meet my
            extended Harlan family.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;But it was a trip which Mary Ann and I made to England and
            Ireland in 1976, which really stimulated my attention toward the
            broader history of the Harlan family. There we visited
            Monkwearmouth, near Durham, the site of the 1650 baptism of George
            Harland, where we met a Joseph Harland, and then traveled to Lurgan
            in Northern Ireland, the site of George and Elizabeth&rsquo;s
            wedding.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;A few years later, aware of the upcoming three hundredth
            anniversary in 1987 of the arrival of George and Michael Harlan in
            Pennsylvania, we drove to New Castle, Delaware, to check out the
            site of the first landing of the Harlans and visited the Historical
            Society in Chester, Pa., where we obtained copies of George
            Harlan&rsquo;s plat of land on the Big Bend of the Brandywine.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;After setting a tentative date for a reunion, we reserved
            Battery Park for a picnic. When asked how many would be present we
            said, &lsquo;Five or five hundred&rsquo; &mdash; we didn&rsquo;t
            know. Our friend and neighbor, Roger Gould, a commercial artist,
            created the logo. Most importantly, we named the prospective event,
            &lsquo;Celebration 300.&rsquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I had received a letter in the mail asking,
            &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to buy a directory of 3,000 Harlans
            for $29,&rsquo; which I bought, and which gave me a starting point
            for organizing a national reunion. We sent letters to 650 Harlans.
            We went through the list and wrote to every fifth name east of the
            Mississippi, and every tenth name west of the Mississippi. In my
            first general letter I stated, &lsquo;I am not a genealogist but do
            possess a love of history. It is because of this historic interest
            rather than genealogical that I believe the tricentennial of the
            arrival of the Harlan family in America deserves to be
            commemorated.&rsquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;People began receiving the announcement and began writing to
            their daughters and to their sisters and cousins, so we built up
            quite an extensive mailing list. We held organizing meetings in St.
            Louis and Denver and, of course, in New Castle. And, as they say,
            &lsquo;the rest is history.&rsquo;&rdquo; Some 800 people attended
            that reunion, and a decision was made to plan another reunion in ten
            years. That was the 1997 reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, where it
            was decided to start holding reunions every five years instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan Harlan has also been at work for many years on a book about his
            parents&rsquo; lives. He completed it in 2005 and brought it to the
            reunion in Reno last year. A copy of this 500-page book, titled<i>
              A Goodly Heritage, The Ancestry, Life and Faith of Pearl Archer
              Harlan, A Latter-Day Circuit Rider, </i
            >will be deposited with the other Harlan archival books and papers
            at the Chester County, Pa., Historical Society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan says that his book &ldquo;is a biographical storybook, not a
            genealogical treatise. My purpose in writing the book was to
            illuminate and preserve for my scattered family, detailed knowledge
            of the life, times and antecedents of those from whom my immediate
            family is descended. I wanted to illustrate a belief which I have
            long espoused, that it is not only the rich and famous who live
            fascinating lives; quiet, modest individuals in all walks of life,
            have colorful, alluring and productive stories to tell.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan is one of those modest individuals. He declined to provide many
            details about his own life in response to our questions about his
            interest in history, preferring to tell about others, and saying
            that he wasn&rsquo;t sure that his professional life would be of
            much interest to others. But a look at his resume provides some
            clues to a fascinating life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan was born in Ohio on December 25, 1923. The son of a Methodist
            pastor, he attended public schools in southeastern Ohio and went on
            to earn a bachelor&rsquo;s in Communication (Journalism) from The
            American University in 1951, and a Master of Divinity from the
            Boston University School of Theology in 1954, where he has also
            completed an additional 30 hours of graduate work in church history
            and biblical studies.
          </p>
          <p>
            He married Mary Ann Austin of Washington, D.C., 59 years ago. In
            addition to raising children, Mary Ann worked as a public school
            teacher in Maine and New Mexico and a bookkeeper for an agency
            serving the developmentally disabled in New Mexico.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan and Mary Ann have four daughters: Christina Harlan, who is on
            the faculty of the School of Public Health, Univ. of N. C., Chapel
            Hill; Karen Marysdaughter, a bookkeeper with a social service agency
            in Maine; Rachel Harlan, a children and youth librarian for the
            Arlington County, Va., Public Library; and Natalie Harlan, who works
            at the Flagstaff Medical Center. Dan and Mary Ann have two
            granddaughters and two grandsons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan&rsquo;s career has included four distinct phases. He worked for
            the U.S. Department of Agriculture as an agricultural economist in
            Washington D.C., from 1942-1951, and he worked for the Maine
            Department of Agriculture as a research associate and later as
            Deputy Commissioner. He received the Honor Award for Excellence in
            Administration from the National Association of State Departments of
            Agriculture in 1983 and chaired the Maine Committee for Heifer
            Project International from 1976-1980.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dan was a Methodist pastor for many years, serving parishes in
            Maine, Alaska, New Mexico, Virginia, and Baltimore, Md. He was a
            delegate to World Methodist Conference in Dublin, Ireland, in 1978
            and was a member of the UM General Council on Ministries 1976-1980.
            He also served on conference boards in Maine.
          </p>
          <p>
            He also owned a book store in Caribou, Maine, for a couple of years.
            In addition to his book, <i>A Goodly Heritage,</i> he is the
            coauthor of the book <i>What God Hath Wrought!,</i> the centennial
            history of Grace UMC, published in 2002, and he is the author of
            <i

          </p>
          <p>
            Dan has touched the lives of so many of us. Junior Harlan, vice
            president of the association, wrote that, &ldquo;Having had the
            opportunity to meet and get to know Dan, I can say that I greatly
            admire him as he has taught me to appreciate family history, not as
            just genealogy, but also in the stories that have surfaced from
            family members through the Harlan association. I have met so many
            wonderful people through the association and it has enriched my
            life. Without his effort in celebrating the 300th, the association
            would not exist, and I have seen it grow to something that we can
            all be proud of.&rdquo;

            The two-manual reed organ, once owned by the Abraham Lincoln family,
            is now being restored, thanks to a gift from The Harlan Family in
            America, in memory of Ridge Latimer Harlan. Ridge was coordinator of
            the national Harlan reunion held in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, in 1997 and
            a long time supporter of the Harlan Family organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The organ is now at the Harlan- Lincoln house in Mt. Pleasant. Two
            residents of the town, Bill and Kathy Layne, are taking the organ
            apart, repairing damaged parts and then rebuilding it. A dedication
            ceremony will take place when the restoration is complete.

            />FORT LEWIS, Washington - First Sgt. William C. Harlan remembers
            seeing the pothole. He could not see the bomb hidden inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan was standing in the squad leader hatch of a Stryker armored
            vehicle, leading a patrol in Mosul, Iraq. The Stryker passed
            directly over the pothole and the bomb erupted with massive force,
            catapulting the 20-ton vehicle several feet into the air.
          </p>
          <p>Harlan was immediately ejected, blasted some 30 feet away.</p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;A staff sergeant, two vehicles back, he saw me fly
            out,&rdquo; Harlan recalled of the March 2006 incident. &ldquo;I
            looked like a rag doll. He was convinced I was already dead.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            The platoon medic, accompanied by soldiers, rushed over to
            administer first aid. Harlan, though critically injured, remained
            calm and directed the security and evacuation plan before being
            taken to a field hospital.
          </p>
          <p>
            He earned a Purple Heart for his service that day in Iraq. But for
            leadership demonstrated last year in helping other wounded troops
            cope with suffering and rehabilitation, Harlan is the 2008 Army
            Times Soldier of the Year.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;He could have easily taken a medical discharge, which he
            could have done with honor. But he chose to stay and chose to
            serve,&rdquo; Col. John G. Norris said in an interview. Norris was
            one of several soldiers who nominated Harlan for the honor.
          </p>
          <p>
            News of the bombing frightened Harlan&rsquo;s family, especially his
            children, Katy, 13, and Andrew, 11. Harlan had returned safely from
            previous tours in Afghanistan in 2002-03 and Iraq in 1990-91.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;We were all scared because none of us knew what was going to
            happen,&rdquo; Katy said as tears welled in her eyes. &ldquo;Our mom
            told us our dad was hurt really bad, he was blown up, and that he
            might not pull through.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan was hospitalized stateside for three months. He underwent 16
            major surgeries to repair dozens of broken bones in his legs, and
            torn ligaments in his right knee. He recovered and walks again, and
            despite lingering physical and mental pain from the injury, elected
            to continue serving on active duty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, even before he was medically cleared for duty, Harlan
            volunteered to help establish the Warrior Transition Battalion at
            Fort Lewis, Wash., a unit designed to help rehabilitate injured
            combat soldiers. Harlan also volunteered to spend time with the
            children of fallen soldiers as part of the post&rsquo;s Tragedy
            Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS).
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I needed to give something back to those who had helped me
            recover,&rdquo; he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan, 39, grew up in Walnut Creek, Calif. He enlisted in the Army
            at age 20 in part because he wanted to serve his country. He opted
            against becoming an officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;I really decided I had more to offer the Army as an NCO than
            an officer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a personality thing.
            You have much more direct influence on young soldiers&rsquo; lives
            as an NCO than you do as an officer.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            His enthusiasm for the job hasn&rsquo;t been lost on his colleagues.
            &ldquo;Leadership from the front, always,&rdquo; Capt. Matthew T.
            Kirby wrote of Harlan. &ldquo;Once in a career, you get the
            opportunity to serve with someone of his caliber.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan has received numerous awards during his military career,
            which he began as a mortarman with the 82nd Airborne Division. His
            Purple Heart and a pair of Bronze Stars adorn the walls of his
            apartment near Fort Lewis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan said an investigation into the Stryker bombing indicated the
            improvised explosive device was likely pressure-triggered and placed
            there by Sunni insurgents. Still, he said, he would return to Iraq
            without hesitation. Above all, Harlan said, he hopes his story
            inspires others. &ldquo;I look at this as a great thing for all
            wounded soldiers who have struggled to come back,&rdquo; he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sgt. Harlan&rsquo;s Headquarters Company is Fort Lewis, Washington.
            His assignment is to the 4th Battalion, 9th Infantry Regiment, 4th
            Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division. He has served
            two tours in Iraq, in 2005-06 and 1990-91, and in Afghanistan in
            2002-03.

            was the subject of two talks at historical societies in
            Pennsylvania.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bruce Mowday, who worked with The Harlan Family in America in
            reprinting Jacob Wright Harlan&rsquo;s book, gave the talks at the
            Tredyffrin-Easttown Historical Society in Chester County and the
            Okahocking Society in Delaware County. Mowday is also scheduled to
            give a talk at the Chris Sanderson Museum in Chadds Ford, Pa., later
            this year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tredyffrin-Easttown Historical Society gave the book, which
            includes an updated history of the Harlan family, a favorable review
            in its Spring 2008 publication. Bonnie Haughey, co-editor of the
            publication, wrote to Mowday, &ldquo;Your story of reprinting the
            first-hand account of a pioneer of local provenance is most
            interesting and I&rsquo;ve found the &lsquo;voice&rsquo; of Jacob
            Wright Harlan a little haunting. I&rsquo;m transported back in time
            as I read about his life and adventure.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            A portion of the sale of the book is contributed to The Harlan
            Family in America. Sales have been brisk since the book&rsquo;s
            release a year ago. Copies are still available from Squire Cheyney

            Jacob Wright Harlan was born in Wayne County, Indiana, on October
            14, 1828, and died on March 7, 1902, in San Leandro, California.
            During his seven decades of life, Jacob took part in many of the
            historic events that led to the settlement of the West, including
            the gold rush and the fight for California independence. He also
            traveled with the ill-fated Donner party. His eyewitness accounts of
            the settlement of the West are an important part of our
            nation&rsquo;s history.

            Reprinted copies are exact duplicates but with smaller margins of
            white space. In the last 20 years, there have been five reprints of
            the book, totaling 2,500 copies, and currently there are only 59
            copies left. There are no plans to reprint the book as a company not

          <p>Here is one account by Virginia Harlan Hess of Windsor, Mo.:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Back in 1957, I was new on the staff of Christian College (now
              Columbia College) in Columbia, Mo., and at lunch one day I met a
              Mrs. Harlan* who was a dormitory housemother on the campus. I told
              her my maiden name was Harlan, and after some discussion (during
              which time she told me she had two fine sons), she asked me if I
              had ever seen the book about the Harlan family. I had never heard
              of it, so she gave me the name of a football coach at the
              University of Missouri who had family connections. I went to see
              him and his book, and I was hooked after finding my
              greatgrandfather&rsquo;s name right there on page 610, # 6807.
            </p>
            <p>
              The coach gave me the name and address of Ruth Leist in
              Miamisburg, Ohio, who was the granddaughter of the book&rsquo;s
              compiler, Alpheus H. Harlan. Since one of my Harlan uncles was
              with the Ohio Department of Education, I sent him the information,
              and he made it a point to look her up. She had a number of unbound
              copies of the book, so Uncle Louis Harlan was able to purchase
              some for family members, including my father. I later ordered one,
              myself, and she had it bound in red buckram. The cost? $15.00!
            </p>
            <p>
              I felt at the time that the book would become a treasure some day
              and wished I could have purchased them for future distribution. I
              have always wondered what became of the dormant stock of unbound
              books Mrs. Leist had in her possession. I&rsquo;m sure Alpheus
              would be gratified to know that his lifetime obsession with the
              chronicling of the family history is now so valued and
              appreciated.

            *In 1986, during the planning of the Harlan Tricentennial
            Celebration, I was happily surprised to learn that Dale Harlan, the
            Christian College housemother, was the mother of Lane and Ridge
            Harlan, to whom we owe so much for the founding of The Harlan Family
            in America.

            />John Marshall Harlan was a justice on the United States Supreme
            Court during a period of time when the court validated segregation
            of the races, denied citizens of American territories Constitutional
            rights, and restricted the government&rsquo;s power to regulate
            business. In important cases in each of these areas, Justice Harlan
            often stood against the popular views of his generation and the
            legal opinions of his associates on the court.
          </p>
          <p>
            In <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> the Supreme Court upheld the right of a
            state to segregate people according to their race in spite of the
            Fourteenth Amendment&rsquo;s guarantees, establishing the infamous
            &ldquo;separate but equal&rdquo; doctrine. Justice Harlan dissented,
            passionately arguing that the Constitution was &ldquo;color
            blind.&rdquo; In the<i> Insular Cases</i> Harlan argued
            unsuccessfully for the extension of the traditional rights of
            citizenship to territorial residents. Finally, Harlan sometimes
            supported in economic cases the government&rsquo;s right to regulate
            business activities. For instance, in Lochner v. New York he
            dissented when the court struck down a New York statute regulating
            working conditions of people employed by bakeries.
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of these opinions, Justice Harlan did not always appear to
            hold &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; views. During the Civil War, he
            opposed the Emancipation Proclamation. In 1882 he voted with a
            unanimous court approving a law that punished an adulterous
            interracial couple more harshly than an adulterous couple of the
            same race. In 1897 he enthuiastically supported the Spanish-American
            War, in spite of significant anti-imperialistic public opposition,
            and then in the Insular Cases ruled to extend constitutional
            protections to the residents of the newly acquired American
            territories.
          </p>
          <p>Could Harlan be trusted? Was he a &ldquo;flip-flopper&rdquo;?</p>
          <p>
            After the U. S. Supreme Court decision in
            <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> (which in effect embraced
            Harlan&rsquo;s dissenting opinion in Plessy), many writers began to
            lionize Harlan as a &ldquo;justice ahead of his time.&rdquo;
            Certainly, <i>Brown</i> was an important decision &mdash; perhaps
            the most important U.S. Supreme Court decision in this century. But
            was Justice Harlan really a &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; thinker? Was
            he really &ldquo;ahead of his time&rdquo;? In
            <i>The Republic According to John Marshall Harlan</i> (Chapel Hill:
            Univ. of N. C. Press, 1999), Linda Przybyszewski attempts to answer
            some of these questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            She believes that Harlan was in many ways a product of his time. She
            explains his decisions in terms of his family, religious, and
            national values. She argues that he was in fact a consistent
            thinker, not a selfserving &ldquo;flip-flopper.&rdquo; Justice
            Harlan, she contends, can be understood by studying his commitment
            to certain &ldquo;myths&rdquo;: his family values (for the most part
            revealed by his wife Malvina Harlan in her memoirs), his religious
            faith, and his belief in American &ldquo;constitutional
            nationalism.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Justice Harlan&rsquo;s thinking was profoundly shaped by his family.
            His father, James Harlan, was a religious slave-owning Kentucky
            politician who believed in a structured society whose leaders should
            benevolently and responsibly care for citizens who were less
            fortunate and powerful. He also believed that owners of slaves
            should care for their property in the same way.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;(Justice) Harlan embraced a political party that championed
            revolutionary legal change in order to preserve some semblance of
            the paternalism he had learned in his father&rsquo;s house,&rdquo;
            states the author.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like his parents and many of his earliest ancestors, Justice Harlan
            was deeply religious. His religious values were reflected in his
            opinions. Justice Brewer once commented that Harlan &ldquo;goes to
            bed every night with one hand on the Constitution and the other on
            the Bible, and so sleeps the sweet sleep of justice and
            righteousness.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Although religious belief was almost universal among justices at the
            time, Harlan distinguished himself from the other justices by being
            committed to a particular brand of religion (perhaps a mixture of
            Quaker and Presbyterian values) that featured paternalism and
            fairness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan&rsquo;s family values blended with his belief in God and his
            belief that the United States was a &ldquo;providential
            nation.&rdquo; Harlan believed that God had established a moral
            foundation for law and that the United States was on a divinely
            appointed mission dating back to colonial times. &ldquo;He used the
            same word &mdash; &lsquo;fathers&rsquo;&mdash; when speaking of the
            founding fathers and the church fathers.&rdquo; Perhaps for these
            reasons, he believed after the Spanish-American War that residents
            of the newly acquired American territories should receive the
            benefits of American citizenship.
          </p>
          <p>
            During his tenure on the court, most of the justices adhered to the
            idea of a ranking of rights: civil rights, political rights, and
            social rights. Most, including Harlan, agreed that the Constitution
            protected the first two. Przybyszewski contends that because of his
            commitment to his particular family, religious and national values,
            Harlan believed that access to public places (theaters, inns,
            railroads) fell into the category of civil rights and that right to
            access to these places was therefore protected. In the arena of
            economic regulation, Justice Harlan&rsquo;s belief in responsible
            paternalism and opposition to slavery of all kinds (including
            economic servitude) led him to advocate in some cases (such as
            Lochner) that the government had the right to regulate abusive
            business practices.

            attendance by her second cousin, Gladys Harlan Montgomery, 93.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unable to attend this year but represented by his son and daughter
            was 99-year-old Gearald Harlan, who will be 100 in November. Another
            regular attendee who was absent this year was 94-year-old Elmer
            Harlan.

            <b>Kurt and Susie Harlan of Molalla, Oregon,</b> won this raffle
            prize. What follows is their account of the trip:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              &ldquo;Our adventure started at the Harlan Family Reunion (2007)
              with the purchase of a few raffle tickets. We wanted to win one of
              the secondary prizes, so we put all but one of our tickets into
              the boxes for the other prizes. Never did we think that our single
              ticket would be the lucky one for the Grand Prize. We were totally
              surprised when our number was called.
            </p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;We anticipated our visit to Meadowood, as we coordinated it
              to happen on the ninth anniversary of our wedding, and we looked
              forward to our pending visit eagerly.
            </p>
            <p>
              &quot;We left our home in Molalla, Oregon, and took a leisurely
              drive to the Oregon Coast, and down the coast to Northern
              California, then headed inland to our destination in the Napa
              Valley. This region is home to some of the world&rsquo;s finest
              wineries.
            </p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;We arrived at Meadowood on a very nice summer day. It was
              very early so we called ahead and they were nice enough to let us
              arrive early. We arrived at the front gate and there is a person
              there making sure everyone who enters has a reservation or is a
              guest. It is very luxurious. Our impression of Meadowood was that
              it was very spendy but very nice. [Editor&rsquo;s note: A look at
              the room tariffs on Meadowood&rsquo;s Web site will confirm this!]
              The people were very nice and wanted to help in any way possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;The grounds were lush and well attended. We drove to the
              main building and checked in, and then we walked to the croquet
              court and sat down to just enjoy the view. There was no one
              playing at the time but it was a beautiful setting. We then went
              back to the office after a while and they had our room ready.
            </p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just a room &mdash; it was more like a
              little cabin. It was connected with the other rooms but in a very
              private way. It was the most beautiful room I have ever seen. They
              had fruit and wine waiting for us and each night they would turn
              the bed down with a cookie on the pillow. It had a soaking tub and
              the best soap and shampoos that you could ever ask for. They were
              &ldquo;Molton Brown&rdquo; and they are the best. (Susie&rsquo;s
              emphasis!)
            </p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;They did have plenty to do. They had golf, tennis, croquet,
              swimming, and hiking trails all over the property. Our tour of a
              local winery was also made through Meadowood. The tour was very
              informative, and we enjoyed the opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;The food at Meadowood was most excellent, prepared by those
              who enjoy the finer points in food preparation, and presentation.
              Our two days there were a most welcome respite from the usual 9-
              5, and we will treasure the experience.&rdquo;

            <a name="donation"></a>Next National Reunion Set For July 2012 in
            San Antonio!
          </h2>
          <p>
            San Antonio, Texas, one of America&rsquo;s hottest vacation
            destinations, is the site for the next Harlan Family in America
            National Reunion!
          </p>
          <p>
            Mark your calendar now for July 5-8, 2012, for the Marriott Plaza
            San Antonio Hotel (Google it for a great tour) for four days of
            family fun, tours, social events and seminars.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Marriott Plaza is a cozy 250-room facility with unparalleled
            spacious and well-manicured grounds and ample conference facilities
            that will serve well for Thursday evening&rsquo;s welcoming
            reception, Friday&rsquo;s Texas-style barbeque picnic, Saturday
            night&rsquo;s gala banquet and Sunday&rsquo;s scrumptious brunch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each reunion also includes a non-denominational church service which
            is planned in an historic church just a short walk from the hotel.
          </p>
          <p>
            San Antonio, of course, is home to numerous tourist attractions and
            is a clean, friendly city. A good Web site to view is
            <a href="http://www.visitsanantonio.com" target="_blank"
              >www.visitsanantonio.com</a
            >. An eight member reunion planning committee personally visited our
            host city in July to experience the many attractions and to select
            the host hotel. The city and the Marriott Plaza won over their
            hearts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The committee will continue to work to deliver a reunion that will
            bring a lot of value for a modest price. You can help. We are
            looking for donations to help offset the cost of the 2012 Reunion. A
            donation form appears above. Donations will be collected to offset
            some of the costs for our four-day gathering, making the event
            attractive for our family members.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also volunteer to serve on the Reunion Committee. We are
            looking for Harlans in the San Antonio area to assist with the
            planning and running of this great event. You can e-mail our
            President, Bob Harlan, at:

            Be looking for reunion planning updates in future Harlan Record
            newsletters and on our family Web site at: www.harlanfamily.org. We

          <h2><a name="gcorner"></a>GENEALOGY CORNER: Helpful Information</h2>
          <p>
            In today&rsquo;s world most researchers find the easiest place to
            begin to do research is on the computer. So many Web sites are
            popping up all of the time. It is hard to know where to go to find
            what. I can remember when I first looked at Cyndi&rsquo;s List, I
            didn&rsquo;t have a clue what category I might want. And to be
            honest I haven&rsquo;t even been to that listing for a long time. I
            do know many of the resources I used several years ago are no longer
            free. So my quest for this newsletter was to find some new sources
            (at least to me) that offer <b>free</b> information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the heading of &ldquo;investigative resources&rdquo; I found
            several Web sites I thought were interesting. One is called
            <a href="http://www.spiesonline.net/" target="_blank"
              >www.spiesonline.net</a
            >. It is a Web site that has a number of selections listed under the
            link &ldquo;Investigative Resources.&rdquo; After you select the
            category you want, the Web site then gives you suggestions as to
            where to go for the type of records or information for which you are
            looking. As an example: under birth records there are four topics
            listed.
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Obtain a copy of a birth certificate &ndash; if, for genealogical
            purposes you just want to verify a birth, this is the way to go.<br />
            2. County courthouse locater &ndash; gets the address and phone
            number for a specific courthouse to obtain records.<br />
            3. &lt; BirthDatabase.com &gt; is a Web site where you can obtain a
            birth date free.<br />
            4. CDC National Center for Health Statistics &ndash; tells you where
            to write for vital statistics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another Web site I found most interesting is called
            <a href="http://www.refdesk.com" target="_blank">www.refdesk.com</a
            >. It has a list of 89 genealogy resources from Ancestral Findings
            to
            <a href="http://www.YourFamily.com" target="_blank"
              >www.YourFamily.com</a
            >. Ancestral Findings gives a list of today&rsquo;s free databases
            (it changes very frequently) and a host of other Web sites and
            information. www.YourFamily.com gives tips for finding missing
            people.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only problem I can foresee with you using these Web sites is you
            will get sidetracked and spend a lot more time than you planned to
            spend. If any of you have been especially successful with a
            particular free Web site please let me know, and I&rsquo;ll share
            the information with our Harlan cousins.
