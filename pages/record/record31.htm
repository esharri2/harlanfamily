          Harlan Family Reunion a Success!
        </b>
        <p>
          After 320 years, the Harlan Family in America is still going strong!
          Family members met in Reno, Nevada, July 12 &#150; 15 for the latest
          national reunion. Over 400 people, many of them first-time attendees,
          took part in the festivities, held at John Ascuaga&#146;s Nugget
          Convention Center. This is the same number of Harlan-kin at the 2002
          reunion in the Pennsylvania.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reunion officially began with a reception Thursday evening, but
          there was a steady stream of Harlans registering throughout the day,
          and the constant hum of voices in the registration/reception area as
          previous reunion attendees caught up and new friendships began.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reception area was in a large, sunny, open room, with plenty of
          space for visiting, purchasing souvenirs, and looking at the displays
          brought by various cousins, with topics ranging from photos of past
          reunions, details of particular family lines, family scrapbooks,
          articles about individuals Harlans, a model of Joel Harlan&#146;s El
          Nido House in San Ramon, and more. On Friday morning, attendees could
          choose from a list of workshops, lounge in the hotel pool or hot tubs,
          or go on a tour to either Donner Memorial Park or Virginia City.
        </p>
        <p>
          The trip to the Donner memorial fit well with the reunion theme, which
          focused on the westward trek of the first Harlans to reach California.
          The Donners, who started out from Missouri traveling with the same
          wagon train as the Harlans, made different route choices than the
          Harlans, and were a week and a half behind when they reached the final
          barrier &#150; the Sierra Nevadas. Their fate is infamous. The
          memorial marks the site where many of them died after being trapped by
          a blizzard on the east side of the Sierras.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Harlans had just made it across the mountains when that weather
          arrived, and they experienced a heavy rain as they descended the
          western slopes. A week and a half made all the difference. They were
          the last group to successfully cross the mountains that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Virginia City is famous for its silver mines, and it is a
          well-preserved, old-fashioned western style town with connections to
          the Harlan family.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Friday afternoon, the reunion group enjoyed a western-style picnic
          in a nearby park. The younger crowd enjoyed playing at the water park
          there, while others found more time for chatting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The general family association meeting was held Friday evening. New
          officers were elected, and the site for the next reunion was
          discussed. By consensus, the group agreed that the board will research
          the possibility of holding it in Texas.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          On Saturday morning, there were more workshops and a repeat of
          Friday&#146;s tours. That evening, there was a banquet with
          recognitions and a keynote address, &#147;One Family&#146;s Defining
          Moment,&#148; presented by William K. Harlan, a descendant of wagon
          master George Harlan (#852). One remark was, &#147;The banquet was
          really great, and Bill&#146;s talk on the Great Trek was a
          winner.&#148;<br />

          /><br />
          On Sunday morning attendees enjoyed a buffet breakfast and/or attended
          a nondenominational worship service to complete the event. The worship
          service, led by C. J. King, honored our Quaker heritage. Dan Harlan,
          who first envisioned a national gathering in 1987 &#150; Celebration
          300 &#150; led the meditation and offered the closing prayer. Mary
          Ellen Black played music for the service. One who attended said,
          &#147;The worship service was one of my favorite events ... it really
          put a wonderful feeling of family to the reunion.&#148;
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          There were 11 different workshops to choose from. These included:
          Chuck Knuthson on the Donner tragedy; Marjory Sgroi on the Harlan
          Heritage tours; Junior Harlan on genealogical research; Dale and Estle
          Harlan on the Quaker influence; and Bruce Mowday on the life of Jacob
          Wright Harlan, whose 1886 autobiography Bruce reissued for the
          reunion. Also, Judi Sommarstrom on making a family scrapbook; Steve
          Harrison on the history of the family in early California; Mike
          Fluetsch on Harlans who were Supreme Court justices; C.J. King on the
          Harlan women who were also Lincolns; Nancy Davenport on the Harlan DNA
          Project; and Carlene Crossman and Ann Averill on Josiah Harlan, the
          first American to visit Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          Most workshop presenters had handouts, some of which may still be
          available for those who were unable to attend.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          Liz Sly received several enthusiastic notes from people during the
          preregistration process, saying they can&#146;t wait for the next
          reunion. &#147;Everyone enjoyed the workshops they attended. The
          subjects were all very intriguing, and folks wanted to go to more, but
          there were schedule restraints,&#148; she reported.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          In response to those comments, the organizers will try to schedule
          future bus trips and workshops so they don&#146;t overlap and to run
          some of the workshops more than once. There were so many great
          offerings at Reno that some were disappointed they couldn&#146;t do
          more.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          Pat Harrison Fluetsch and William K. Harlan were coordinators for the
          reunion, assisted by core committee members Joe and LaRena Hannon, and
          Robert R. Harlan (&#147;California Bob&#148;).
        </p>

                  &#149; While waiting for an elevator at the reunion, a small
                  child &#150; seeing all the Harlan nametags &#150; asked his
                  mom, &#147;What&#146;s a Harlan?&#148; She answered,
                  &#147;It&#146;s a motorcycle.&#148;

                  &#149; A good looking man in an elevator at the hotel asked,
                  &#147;How can I get in the Harlan Family?&#148; A Harlan
                  attendee offered her single sister in marriage, but he got off
                  on the next floor!

    </p>
    <p>
      The late Robert Harlan, who retired to Freeport, Ill., after a 30-year
      diplomatic career, was a college exchange student in Germany in 1938 and
      saw firsthand the destruction caused by the infamous event known as
      Kristallnacht. As a result, he helped a Jewish couple who were among the
      victims, and he found them a way to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kristallnacht translates as &#147;Crystal Night,&#148; or &#147;Night of
      the Broken Glass,&#148; a name that aptly describes the streets of many
      German villages after a night of rioting destroyed thousands of Jewish
      homes, synagogues and businesses in November 1938. Soldiers and citizens
      alike took part in these hateful acts, clearly exposing to the world the
      depth of anti-Semitic feeling, and what the Nazi government would
      tolerate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, evidence suggests that the government encouraged its officers to
      organize these riots as retribution for the murder of a German diplomat in
      Paris. Shot by an irate Jew, the diplomat had ignored the man&#146;s
      repeated pleas to help his relatives and 17,000 other Jews imprisoned at a
      refugee camp. Two days later, on November 9, 1938, the diplomat, Ernst vom
      Rath, died. The riots began that night and lasted for several days. Adding
      insult to injury, the Nazi government then fined the Jewish communities
      one billion marks for causing the riots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, this is but part of a continuing story. But it is the part that
      Bob Harlan witnessed firsthand, through his friendship with Doktor and
      Frau Stern, of Wurzburg, Germany, parents of William, Bob&#146;s
      German-Jewish boss at the Law Library of the University of Chicago. Bob
      had promised William to visit them while he was in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first visit was in early September 1938. He intended to stay for a few
      hours and ended up staying 10 days. During this time, he hiked and biked
      with Frau Stern&#146;s cousin, whose factory made large crates for the
      many Jewish emigrants shipping their possessions out of the country. From
      Herr Doktor he learned about politics, law, and other topics, and Frau
      Stern tutored him in German.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan described the doctor as a &#147;prominent lawyer, once regarded as
      a leading citizen, formerly holder of several important and honored
      municipal positions, winner of numerous military honors during the war
      [WWI], and [an] extremely able, educated and cultured gentleman.&#148; But
      by 1938, Jews were already being segregated from German social and
      political life. The last day of the visit was &#147;marred by a
      communication received by Herr Doktor Stern at his office.&#148; The note,
      sent by some petty official, instructed the doctor that he must
      immediately sell his house and inform the officer of the price and the
      purchaser&#146;s name. The note concluded by threatening, &#147;If you do
      not do as I ask, I may be forced to take further steps.&#148;&#147;It was
      with the contents of that foreboding note ringing in my ears that I
      pedaled away next morning, heading south for Munich and
      Gemutlichkeit,&#148; Harlan recalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sterns visited him in Munich, and he visited them again in early
      October. Frau Stern said they had not sold their house as instructed, but
      a few days earlier, they&#146;d been informed that the house had been
      transferred and was no longer theirs. The doctor was also told to close
      his law office by December 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan soon left feeling &#147;anything but happy about the plight of my
      friends, but not knowing what, if anything, I could do. &#133; Just a
      month later, on Friday, November 11th, a telegram from Wurzburg shocked me
      from my complacency.&#148; Translated, it said, &#147;Please come at once
      to William&#146;s mother.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know why he was being summoned, only that something very bad
      had happened. He wrote, &#147;The day before, the Marburg synagogue had
      burned down, but the general feeling in Marburg seemed to be that it was
      an accident. It was not even in the paper. And the day before, vom Rath
      ... had died. For some reason, I failed at the time to connect these three
      events - the death, the fire, and the telegram - or if I did it was only
      hazily.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      He boarded the first train to Wurzburg. Arriving around 10 p.m., he was
      greeted by an overwrought, young woman, who asked his identity and had him
      follow her to an apartment to meet Frau Stern, who wept as she explained
      that her husband had been taken away the night before and their house
      ransacked. She was hiding in this apartment of a relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#147;Feeling helpless but knowing something must be done, if only to calm
      this frantic woman, I began to formulate telegrams and cables with
      her,&#148; Harlan wrote. &#147;She had three sons in America, one of them
      about to become a citizen. There was her ray of hope. If definite evidence
      as to Doktor and Frau Stern&#146;s certain departure from Germany could be
      secured, the treatment accorded them would doubtless be less harsh.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, they visited the Sterns&#146; apartment. &#147;Never had
      I seen such methodic diabolic destruction,&#148; Harlan wrote. &#147;Every
      door was smashed, the furniture splintered to nothing, each picture ripped
      from the wall and torn from its frame; books emptied out of bookcases,
      torn and despoiled; dishes tossed and crashed in all directions; mirrors
      shattered systematically; the wonderful grandfather&#146;s clock,
      generations old, crushed upon its face &#133;
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent the day cleaning up. Some things were repaired; others packed
      for shipping. The next day, the paper announced the billion-mark fine and
      reported on the &#147;spontaneous uprisings&#148; of people acting from
      &#147;righteous wrath&#148; against the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan left the next day, feeling he&#146;d done all he could. To stay
      more than three days, he would have to register with the police. He told
      Frau Stern to keep in touch with the nearest American Consulate and
      promised he would write them as well. Less than two weeks later, he
      visited the consulate in Stuttgart, the main office for processing
      emigration applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#147;The sight that met my eyes that morning &#133; was far from
      encouraging. The stairway, from top to bottom, was filled with faces,
      patient, waiting faces, eager yet despairing, hopeful yet distrustful,
      waiting, hoping, waiting. And I knew even then that for most of them, with
      very few exceptions, America was at least four years distant. There were
      simply too many thousands of applications ahead of them.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      The main problem for anyone wishing to move away from his/her country was
      finding another country to accept him/her. This was especially difficult
      for the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      American passport in hand, Bob was allowed into the office upstairs, which
      was also filled with applicants. Eventually he spoke with a &#147;harassed
      overworked&#148; vice-consul, who told him the Sterns could do nothing but
      wait their turn. When their son became a citizen, though, they could get a
      visa to visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He decided to wander into the English Consulate, where he discovered an
      &#147;unconsidered means of escape.&#148; The Sterns could get a transit
      visa to England if they could prove they were headed elsewhere within a
      couple of months. The Sterns had friends in England who could help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harlan rushed to Frau Stern with the happy news and found another reason
      for rejoicing &#150; the doctor had been released. A few days later, their
      English visa came through, and a few weeks later, in late December, after
      shipping as many possessions as possible, they departed safely.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a stay in England, the Sterns settled in State College, Pa., where
      their youngest son was in school. They struggled to adjust to their new
      life, and they stayed in touch with Bob and his wife Lois, whom he married
      in 1942. Both Sterns died in 1957, after 18 years in the U.S.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lois shared her late husband&#146;s story with Freeport, Ill.,
      Journal-Standard columnist Harriett Gustason, who printed the full version
      of his seven-page memoir in three installments published in October and
      November 2005.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gustason concluded the final installment with the following recollection
      from Lois:<br />
      &#147;Lois Harlan said &#133; the Sterns sent them something &#145;very
      special&#146; as a wedding gift. It was a &#145;charming small bronze
      figure of a little boy playing the flute, while lizards crawl at this
      feet.&#146; &#133; &#145;A lizard and part of the flute is
      missing,&#146;&#148; Lois told Gustason.

      <strong><a name="newbook"></a>New Book Edition Was a Hit at Reno</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      A new edition of the popular, and previously out-of-print, book by Jacob
      Wright Harlan is available for purchase for holiday gifts. The book was
      popular at the recent Harlan Family in America reunion in Reno.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Wright Harlan&#146;s <em>California 1846-1888</em> is published in
      its entirety. Also included in the book are additional sections on Harlan
      family history. The repackaged book is titled
      <em
        >Eyewitness to the Settlement of the West: Jacob Wright Harlan&#146;s
        California 1846-1888.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The book was published by Squire Cheyney Books earlier this year with the
      cooperation of the Harlan Family in America. Part of the proceeds of each
      sale of the book through the Harlan family organization will be donated to
      The Harlan Family in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Wright Harlan was born in Wayne County, Ind., on October 14, 1828,
      and died on March 7, 1902, in San Leandro, Calif. During his seven decades
      of life, Jacob took part in many of the historic events that led to the
      settlement of the West, including the gold rush and the fight for
      California independence. He was also a member of the Harlan/ Donner party.
      His eyewitness accounts of the settlement of the West are an important
      part of our nation&#146;s history.

    <p>
      <strong><em>* Four Marys and a Jessie</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Reunion workshop presenter C.J. King shared stories about our Harlan
      &#150; Lincoln cousins from her book,
      <em>Four Marys and a Jessie: The Story of the Lincoln Women.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The book traces the connections between Mary Todd Lincoln and her
      daughter-in-law, Mary Harlan Lincoln; her granddaughters, Mary and Jessie;
      and her great-granddaughter, Mary, known as &#147;Peggy.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Set in the context of changing social expectations for women, the book
      focuses on the private relationships of these women. Abraham
      Lincoln&#146;s reputation always overshadowed their lives; nevertheless,
      he is a minor character in the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      C.J. sold copies of the book at the reunion, but they were sold out before
      the reunion ended. Those still wishing to purchase the book can order them
      directly from C.J. with a check for $24 each, to 2791 Turkey Mountain Rd.,
      Jamaica, VT 05343; or from the publisher, Hildene, the Lincoln Family
      Home, via<br />
      their Web site: www.hildene.org . Hildene has signed copies; books ordered
      from C.J. can be personalized.

      <strong><em>* The Man Who Would be King</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Carlene Crossman and Ann Averill presented a workshop at the reunion
      titled &#147;Josiah Harlan: The First American in Afghanistan,&#148; based
      on the book,
      <em>The Man Who Would be King &#151; The First American in Afghanistan</em
      >, by Ben Macintyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book is based on Harlan&#146;s old, tattered autobiography, found by
      Macintyre in the Chester County, Pa., archives. This is the true story of
      the man who inspired Rudyard Kipling's fictionalized tale.<br />
      Macintyre&#146;s book describes Josiah Harlan as &#147;soldier, spy,
      doctor, naturalist, traveler and writer.&#148; Harlan spent 20 years in
      central Asia. After leading native soldiers to the summit of the Afghani
      Hindu Kush, he declared himself Prince of Ghor, then proceeded to carve
      out his own kingdom, only to be expelled later by the invading British.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in his native country, he led troops during the Civil War and tried
      introducing camels as a viable means of transportation in the American
      West &#151; that idea failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These and other details of Josiah Harlan&#146;s life are told in
      Macintyre&#146;s book, published in 2004 by Farrar, Straus and Giroux of
      New York. It is available in bookstores and by special order.

        he&#146;s the expert, we asked him to explain his profession to Harlan
        Record readers.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish Culture Hall of Fame? What&#146;s that? For that matter, what is fish
      culture; and why should we be interested? Explanations are required, so
      let&#146;s provide some background information.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the great-grandson of Elizabeth Harlan Nickum and Peter Nickum. My
      Harlan lineage is George, Aaron, Aaron, James, Elihu, Elizabeth. This
      explains the connection between the Harlan Family and the Fish Culture
      Hall of Fame, but it does not answer the question, &#147;What is this Hall
      of Fame?&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fish Culture Hall of Fame was established in 1985 at the D.C. Booth
      Historic National Fish Hatchery, located in Spear-fish, S.D. It was
      established to recognize and honor individuals &#147;who have made a
      difference&#148; in the development of the art and science of fish
      culture. I will be the 50th person in the Hall of Fame when I&#146;m
      inducted next May. Inductees include individuals who served as the
      &#147;founding fathers of fish culture&#148; during the late 1800s, up to
      a few recently retired scientists and practical fish farmers who have been
      deemed worthy by their professional peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish culture includes all of the activities, practices, and systems used
      to rear fish under controlled conditions. In general, fish are reared, or
      cultured, or propagated, so as to produce greater numbers and more
      predictable numbers than in the wild. Literally hundreds of species are
      propagated worldwide, primarily for use as human food, but also for
      managing and restoring natural, wild populations of fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States, fish culture is dominated by State and Federal
      hatcheries that produce fish for use in fisheries management, while most
      foreign countries rear species that are desired for human food. If fish
      are cultured appropriately, they are excellent human food and look and
      behave very similarly to wild fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish culturists need to be both practical farmers and resourceful
      scientists to manage all the conditions required to rear fish under
      controlled conditions. Fish culturists must understand and manipulate
      myriad variables to not only keep their fish alive, but to do so in a
      manner that is efficient and profitable. They have to be able to
      &#147;think like a fish&#148; in order to understand how different life is
      for a fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, fish cannot control their body temperature, so the water has
      to be the right temperature for each species. There are unique food
      requirements for each species. And yes, fish do have diseases, caused by
      parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This is just one more concern for
      the fish culturist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish live on extremely low levels of oxygen dissolved in the water. Water
      usually contains less than 10 parts per million of dissolved oxygen. In
      contrast, our atmosphere is approximately 200,000 parts per million. Fish
      culturists must be constantly alert for any decrease in dissolved oxygen
      in the tanks, raceways, and ponds that serve as rearing units.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fish are also unique in the way in which they get rid of nitrogenous
      metabolic wastes. We excrete such products as urea, commonly called urine.
      Fish excrete nitrogenous wastes as ammonia through their gills, the very
      structures they use to extract oxygen from their environment. (Think of it
      as peeing through your lungs!)
    </p>
    <p align="left">
      I worked primarily as a researcher and a teacher, but also served as
      program manager in the Federal government. I taught and conducted research
      at South Dakota State University, Cornell University, and Iowa State
      University. My students and I conducted research that improved rearing
      practices for rainbow trout, channel catfish, and centrarchid bass, as
      well as developing techniques for rearing such species as walleyes and
      black bullheads.
    </p>
    <p>
      I served as the Director of the Cornell University Interdepartmental
      Aquaculture Program before moving on to positions as
      National&#150;International Fish Health Coordinator and National
      Aqua-culture Coordinator in the Department of the Interior. I also served
      as vice-chair of the federal Joint Subcommittee on Aqua-culture. I&#146;m
      fortunate to have had a varied and extremely interesting career in which I
      could mix pure science, practical farming, and the use of propagated fish
      in fisheries management.
    </p>
    <p>
      An interesting sidelight is another connection between Harlans and fish
      from the &#147;Fish Care Era,&#148; a time in which cultured fish were
      hauled, literally, from coast-to-coast in modified railway cars
      manufactured by the firm of Harlan and Hollingsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that is a tale for another time; perhaps the next issue of the Harlan
      Record.

      Kiana Yager became an actress by accident, but she&#146;s discovered that
      she loves it! This eight-year-old Harlan cousin from western Kansas will
      be featured in the upcoming mini-series Comanche Moon, airing on CBS this
      November.
    </p>
    <p>
      She has no lines to speak, but she&#146;ll be clearly recognizable as one
      of two sisters kidnapped by Indians the first night of the series.
    </p>
    <p>
      This western drama is a &#147;prequel&#148; to Lonesome Dove, part of
      Larry McMurtry&#146;s Lonesome Dove series that follows the lives of
      several Texas Rangers. Kiana worked with some well known actors, including
      Steve Zahn, Val Kilmer, Karl Urban, Linda Cardellini, and Elizabeth Banks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, she&#146;s low-key about it all. When people make a big deal about
      her success, she&#146;s apt to say something like, &#147;Yea, that was
      cool.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Kiana&#146;s older brother Chantz who first had acting aspirations.
      Their mother, Jodi, wrote to 30 agencies in surrounding states, and three
      invited him for an interview. When Jodi asked if she could bring all four
      of her children to an audition, rather than hire a babysitter, she was
      told yes. The agent signed them all up, and they began getting different
      kinds of jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jodi and James Yager&#146;s four children include Colten, age 12; Chantz,
      10; Kiana, 8; and Hunter, 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chantz was Guy Pearce in a movie called First Snow, but since then, he and
      his brothers are focusing on other things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiana&#146;s interest, on the other hand, is growing. She was an extra in
      the Hallmark Hall of Fame movie, In From the Night. Though it was just a
      small part, Jodi says, &#147;That&#146;s when we realized she really loved
      this.&#148;<i
        ><img
          src="/record/Record pics/Kiana 2.jpg"
          width="317"
          height="383"
          align="right"
      /></i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiana is pursuing acting in a big way. In 2006, she won the Miss Colorado
      Princess title; she was runner-up the year before. At the National
      American Miss competition last fall, she won the &#147;National
      Spokesmodel&#148; title for the best speech of all the contestants. She
      has also won numerous other titles, such as Most Promising Model and
      recently won first place as the state&#146;s Best Actress in her age
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before all of this, Kiana&#146;s parents worried that she was too shy, but
      it turns out that on stage, &#147;Her poise is awesome,&#148; Jodi said.
      &#147;She&#146;s not scared at all.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Kiana won a scholarship to a weekend acting school in Colorado Springs,
      where she attracted the attention of a California agent. And depending on
      the results of acompetition this coming January, she may take up acting
      full time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doing so may cause some logistical challenges to her family, but
      they&#146;ll cross that bridge when they come to it. Her father is a
      chiropractor starting to practice is hishometown, Scott City, in
      west-central Kansas. But her family is excited for her, and they&#146;re
      determined to find a way to support her talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Harlan Family has many notables on its family tree, and Kiana is
      stepping up to make her mark. Check your local listings and watch her this
      fall!

        Some Genealogy Humor &#150; Can you relate to these???<br />
        1. My family coat of arms ties at the back.....is that normal?<br />
        2. My family tree is a few branches short! All help appreciated.<br />
        3. My ancestors must be in a witness protection program!<br />
        4. Shake your family tree and watch the nuts fall!<br />
        5. My hobby is genealogy. I raise dust bunnies as pets.<br />
        6. How can one ancestor cause so much TROUBLE??<br />
        7. I looked into my family tree and found out I was a sap.....<br />
        8. I&#146;m not stuck, I&#146;m ancestrally challenged.<br />
        9. I&#146;m searching for myself. Have you seen me?<br />
        10. If only people came with pull-down menus and on-line help.<br />
        11. Isn&#146;t genealogy fun? The answer to one problem leads to two
        more!<br />
        12. It&#146;s 2007.....do you know where your Great-Great-Grandparents
        are?<br />
        13. A family reunion is an effective form of birth control.<br />
        14. A family tree can wither if nobody tends its roots.<br />
        15. A new cousin a day keeps the boredom away.<br />
        16. After 30 days, unclaimed ancestors will be adopted.<br />
        17. Am I the only person up my tree? Sure seems like it.<br />
        18. Any family tree produces some lemons, some nuts and a few bad
        apples.<br />
        19. Ever find an ancestor HANGING from the family tree?<br />
        20. FLOOR: The place for storing your priceless genealogy records.<br />
        21. Gene-Allergy: It&#146;s a contagious disease, but I love it.<br />
        22. Genealogists are time unravelers.<br />
        23. Genealogy is like playing hide and seek: They hide, I seek!<br />
        24. Genealogy: tracing yourself back to better people.<br />
        25. &#147;Crazy&#148; is a relative term in my family.<br />
        26. A pack rat is hard to live with, but makes a fine ancestor.<br />
        27. I want to find ALL of them! So far I only have a few thousand.<br />
        28. I should have asked them BEFORE they died!<br />
        29. I think my ancestors had several &#147;bad heir&#148; days.<br />
        30. I&#146;m always late. My ancestors arrived on the JUNE flower.<br />
        31. Only a Genealogist regards a step backwards as progress.<br />
        32. Share your knowledge. It is a way to achieve immortality.
