        <br />

        Sixteen hardy present-day Harlans have a story to tell fellow Harlans
        about their trip to Northeast England, a trip that took them back
        through 14 generations to their common roots.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        The highlight of the 12-day journey was participating in Sunday
        Eucharist at the historic St. Peter&#146;s Church in Monkwearmouth. It
        was there in 1650 that George Harlan (#3) was baptized soon after he was
        born. Still standing at that time, along with the rebuilt sanctuary, was
        the west wall and its rock tower, built of local stone and still intact
        despite years of Viking plundering. It was the only part of the original
        church that had survived.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        The Harlan cousins learned much of England&#146;s history between their
        arrival at Gatwick airport on May 5 and departure May 14 from Liverpool.
        A visit to the ancient Druid site at Stonehenge started the tour. Next,
        the group went to Bath.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Bath, with its 2,000-year-old Roman bath center and historic Bath Abbey,
        set the mood for historic search. Bath and its Roman Temple became an
        important seat of Roman culture soon after its legions swept over
        southwest England. The elaborate system of bath houses, all fed from a
        steady underground flow of warm water, and rooms heated by servants are
        vivid reminders of how the aristocrats lived then.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Burford, northward, was a nearby stop with its long main street lined
        with a wide variety of shops full of English wares. Blenheim Palace soon
        was upon us. There, Winston Churchill was born in a large room in the
        front part of the expansive building. The sandstone exterior had begun
        to show some signs of weathering as had buildings in many of the
        roadside stops.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Next we were visitors at Broughton House, where the original medieval
        manor house was built in 1300. Parts of the manor, surrounded by a moat,
        were familiar to movie fans who had seen &#147;Shakespeare in
        Love.&#148;
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        The Cotswolds area was next. A short drive northward offered a visit to
        Chipping-Campden for two nights and a visit to one of England&#146;s
        oldest formal silversmith guild shops, the Guildhall of Handcraft,
        established in 1888. Owner David Hart and his staff demonstrated Middle
        Age skills needed for the work.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        For those among us who are fans of English mystery writer Dick Francis,
        Chipping-Campden held a special interest, as the place is mentioned so
        often in his tales of steeple chasing intrigue. Tradition has it that
        steeple chasing became the main horsemanship sport as they raced between
        villages. Many villages were within running distance as competitors
        raced from church steeple to steeple.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        We came upon Harlan family lore first in the York area where grave
        monuments to several Harlands were located at All Hallows Church in
        Sutton Park.
        <img
          src="../images/StPeters03.jpg"

        />Oldest was Richard Harland (1592-1689). Richard, along with 10 other
        Harlands, was entombed within the church. Three others were in the
        graveyard. Nearby was Sutton manor house, a former home of some
        Harlands. Efforts to establish lineage between Richard&#146;s line and
        James Harlan were unsuccessful, according to John R. Harlan, treasurer
        of The Harlan Family in America association.
      </p>

      <div align="left">
        By Saturday, the Harlan adventurers were in Durham, site of the famed
        Durham Cathedral. Here again we were treated to a famous movie set,
        where &#147;Elizabeth&#148; was filmed. Durham is in northeast England,
        just south of Northumberland, where St. Peter&#146;s Church is
        located.<br />

        If there had been criminal elements among our clan alive before 1624,
        Durham Cathedral monastery would have been their haven. That&#146;s when
        King James I abolished the designation of monasteries as a protected
        sanctuary for criminals. The heavy round iron knocker still is attached
        to the main entrance door on the church. It was activated by criminals.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        According to Venerable Bede, the era&#146;s foremost authority on
        Christianity in England, Durham offered safe haven for 37 days, during
        which criminals could organize their affairs and arrange for relatives
        to pay their fines. Anyone convicted of murder could confess and agree
        to make his way to a port to be banned for life.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        We were told that Harlans had been members here. A present day Harland
        area resident, Erasmus Harland, reviewed various Harlan(d) connections
        when he spoke at an evening meal in Durham. He related several family
        stories, including the success of the Harland &amp; Wolff shipbuilding
        firm in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The firm&#146;s facility was builder
        of the Titanic, he said.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        We went to Grasmere on Sunday afternoon for two nights. The tiny resort
        village is located in the heart of the Lake District. Our hotel was
        located across the little road from the home of poet William Wordsworth.
        A cruise on Lake Windermere capped a day of<img

        />sightseeing. Liverpool and its extensive maritime museum helped tell
        the story of how Harlands and other families came to leave for Ireland
        and America. A farewell dinner and early flights out of nearby
        Manchester closed the journey.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        The tour was arranged by Ashton-Drye Associates and headed by Marjorie
        Harlan Sgroi of Orchard Park, N.Y. Margie kept the schedule together and
        provided an outstanding driver, Brian Bundock, who had the skill to
        shrink our bus thin enough to pass trucks on England&#146;s narrow back
        roads.<br />

        John Harlan and his wife, Annette, of Augusta, Ga., represented the
        Harlan Family association. Other travelers were Shirley May of
        Florissant, Mo., and her daughter Karen May of St. Louis; Dr. Katherine
        Harlan of Vienna, Va., and her son, Dr. Tim Harlan of Linden, Va.; Dr.
        Mary Harlan Murphy of Wayne, Pa.; Pat McCurdy of Tulsa, Okla.; Becky
        Hines of Hagerstown, Ind.; Nancy Gooding of Evans, Ga., and Jane Beson
        of Summerville, S.C., daughters of John and Annette Harlan; Robert and
        Peggy Hewitt of Miamisburg, Ohio; and Charlie and Mary Lea Hamilton of
        Greensboro, N.C.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        This Harlan visit to St. Peter&#146;s occurred some 1300 years after it
        was established, in an agreement between a Northumbrian nobleman,
        Benedict Biscop, and King Egfrith of Northumbria, in whose court Biscop
        was serving.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Biscop had a great impact on this part of northeast England. At 25, he
        made a pilgrimage to Rome and renounced his privileged life for that of
        a monk. Several years later he returned to Northumbria to satisfy his
        yearning for a new monastic community. King Egfrith answered his request
        and agreed to offer support and protection and enough land to support 70
        families.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        The monastery construction was begun in 674 AD. The little church of St.
        Peter&#146;s was started a year later. The dual project brought many
        artisans and builders to the banks of the Wear River. For 200 years the
        monastery and its library became known as a center of Christian light
        and learning. Its contributions to Christendom brought more gifts and
        means for expansion.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        The monastery&#146;s most famous product was Venerable Bede, who entered
        in 680 when he was seven years old.
        <img

        />Literature students in both England and America still study his
        writings today. The Harlan sojourners learned that at the end of the 8th
        Century the monastery&#146;s influence was ended by frequent raids from
        fierce roving Vikings. Their plundering produced the old Anglo-Saxon
        litany: &#147;From the Fury of the Norsemen, Good Lord Deliver Us.&#148;
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        But always the west wall and tower of St. Peter&#146;s was left
        standing. It was still there in 1650 for little George Harland&#146;s
        baptism, and it remains today as a spot in northeast England where
        Harlans still can glow in their heritage.

          Cherokees</b
        ><br />

        Submitted by Barbara Goss Dunlap, Tulsa, OK
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Recently I began researching my Harlan ancestor, fifth great-grandfather
        Ellis (#121), son of Ezekiel (#23) and Hannah Oborn. I found that Ellis
        was born about 1731 in Chester County, Pa., and died in September, 1815.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        About 1776 he married a full-blood Cherokee (name unknown), and it is
        believed that daughter Susannah (#497-g) was from this marriage. (This
        differs from Alpheus Harlan&#146;s book.)
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Ellis married again about 1778, to Katie (Catherine in Alpheus
        Harlan&#146;s book&#151;see page 75), another full-blood Cherokee, in
        Tennessee, Cherokee Nation East. He was Katie&#146;s third husband.
        Katie was the daughter of Kingfisher (Deer Clan) and Nancy Ward (Wolf
        Clan), who was called Beloved Woman of the Cherokees. She was named
        Nancy by the missionaries, but her Cherokee name came from her bravery.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Nancy (pronounced NANYI-HI) was born about 1738 and died in 1822. In
        1755, Nancy was fighting by Kingfisher&#146;s side when Creek warriors
        killed him at the battle of Taliwa. She grabbed his rifle and led the
        Cherokees to victory. She was then chosen as GHIGAU, which translates as
        Beloved Woman. She had absolute power over the fate of prisoners, was a
        voting member of the Council and a very important woman in the Cherokee
        government.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        About 1759, she wed a white trader, Bryan Ward. Nancy was a friend of
        white settlers, believing in peace between Indians and whites. Nancy was
        known as a &#147;patriot&#148; during the Revolutionary War and has been
        described as a tall, erect, beautiful, queenly woman. Her ancestors are
        eligible to join DAR.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Nancy fed many prisoners and helped some escape. In 1776 she warned the
        settlers of an impending attack by the Cherokees, instigated by the
        British. Nancy saved the life of Mrs. William Bean, a white prisoner,
        and it has been said that in turn Mrs. Bean taught Nancy how to make
        butter and perform other housekeeping chores.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Nancy died in 1822 and her gravesite, now a state park, is located south
        of Benton, Tenn.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        Ellis and Katie Harlan, married in 1778, had six children: Nancy,
        George, Ezekiel, Ruth, Sarah (Alpheus calls her Sallie) and Elizabeth. I
        descend from their daughter, Nancy (#497-a) and her husband Caleb Starr.
      </p>

      <p align="left">
        During the Revolutionary War, the British took Ellis prisoner. While he
        was being held, the Tories and their Cherokee allies seized some of
        Ellis&#146; property, for which he was never paid. After his death, his
        son Ezekiel claimed payment owed to &#147;Ellis Harlan, deceased&#148;
        from the Cherokee Council.
      </p>

        />Ellis had died by the time funds became available for these debts, in
        1835. The heirs attempted to collect the debt, but there were disputes
        among them. In the end, it was determined that Ezekiel&#146;s brother
        George had sold his rights to the debt to Ezekiel. Ezekiel&#146;s wife
        (now remarried to Silas Perry) and children received 2/7 of the
        distribution. Ezekiel&#146;s five sisters each received 1/7.

      <b><a name="bluerock"></a>Have You Heard of Blue Rock?</b><br />

      <br />

      Richard C. Walz has heard a lot of Harlan stories over the years, and he
      takes as much interest in the Harlan name as in his own.
    </p>

    <p>
      His grandfather-in-law, James Fred Harlan (1869-1956) raised show roosters
      in Ohio that were sometimes kept in wooden crates labeled with the words
      &#147;Blue Rock.&#148; In fact, he called his roosters Blue Rocks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Richard learned why they were called this when his father-in-law, Charles
      Jeffrey Harlan (1899-1983), James&#146; son, died. Richard noticed the
      Blue Rock postmark on some old mail. An atlas revealed the little town of
      Blue Rock, located near Zanesville, Ohio.
    </p>

    <p>
      Richard&#146;s curiosity led him to drive to Blue Rock, and while he was
      visiting its cemetery, he located graves of three Harlans, possibly Civil
      War veterans. Blue Rock State Park is in the area.
    </p>

    <p>
      Richard, who lives in Cleveland, spends his retirement years helping
      others. He keeps tools in his car and helps build for Habitat for
      Humanity. He was involved in a thrift store in Phoenix whose profits will
      help widowed persons, and he has given his time and talents to orphanages
      and schools in Russia (2000-2001). At home he helps churches and community
      theaters, as well as researches Harlan connections!<br />

        >(Ed. Note: You may have written checks that were printed by the John H.
        Harland Company and wondered how it fits into the Harlan(d) Family? A
        recent inquiry to the company resulted in the following story, written
        in 1976, about the company&#146;s founder. It is printed with permission
        of the John H. Harland Company. The company has now expanded its

      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Several years ago, Mr. Harland was interviewed for a series of stories on
      the history of his company and his involvement with it. His answer to one
      of the last questions in that interview is above.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no doubt that his wish will be fulfilled, for everyone who knew
      him received a blessing of friendship, loyalty, and genuine concern.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our beloved founder passed away on March 5 (1976) at the age of 91
      following a brief illness. Ceremonies were held at St. Luke&#146;s
      Episcopal Church in Atlanta and the family has asked that anyone wishing
      to honor Mr. Harland make a donation to any one of three of his favorite
      charities&#151;The Atlanta Boy&#146;s Clubs, St. Luke&#146;s Episcopal
      Church, or The Henrietta Egleston Hospital.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Mr. Harland first came to America in 1901, the only person here he
      knew was his uncle in Providence, Rhode Island. He was a stranger in a
      strange country. When he left this earth on March fifth, his friends,
      associates in business, and employees numbered in the thousands. He was no
      longer a stranger.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Harland came to Atlanta in 1906, and after a brief period of
      employment with American Express Company, he joined Foote and Davies
      Printing. Staying with Foote and Davies for 17 years, he rose to the
      position of cashier, then treasurer.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the desire that brought him to America from his beloved Northern
      Ireland drove him to be something more.
    </p>

    <p>
      So in 1923, he, along with four other investors, began the John H. Harland
      Company. Their initial investment of $50,000 for one small print shop on
      the second floor of the original Coca-Cola building has grown to 25 plants
      across the country and sales of over $44 million for 1975.
    </p>

    <p>
      But those early years were not easy years by any stretch of the
      imagination. In fact, net profit from operations in 1932 was just 31
      cents. With that rather inauspicious ending for 1932, who knew what 1933
      would hold.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fortunately it held good news. Early that year Roosevelt became president
      and declared a banking holiday. This meant the banks across the country
      had no idea when they would next receive a supply of cash from the
      treasury.
    </p>

    <p>
      This fear led the banks in Atlanta to decide to issue scrip of their own
      so Atlanta and the area surrounding it would have a supply of
      &#147;money.&#148; Harland was selected to print the scrip and produced
      millions of dollars in Atlanta Clearing House notes in a week.
    </p>

    <p>
      The crisis eventually lessened but the banks had called on Harland, and
      the company had responded on their terms and within the time limit
      specified. Thus, Harland&#146;s relationship with the banking community
      was strengthened and has grown tremendously from those doubt-ridden
      Depression years.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Forties and Fifties were growth decades for Harland. The first branch
      operation was opened in Orlando in 1948, followed by Nashville in 1952,
      Greensboro in 1955, and New Orleans in 1959.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Fifties also brought about another banking development, which was to
      act as the final step in tying Harland with the financial institutions of
      America.
    </p>

    <p>
      Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) encoding of account numbers was
      developed by the American Bankers Association, and Harland was among the
      checkprinters asked to implement the program. Many checkprinters who
      doubted the benefit of high-speed check processing by computer equipment
      did not participate. They eventually changed their minds or are no longer
      in the check-printing <br />

      business.
    </p>

    <p>
      From there, the story of the company Mr. Harland founded in the summer of
      1923 is history and well known.
    </p>

    <p>
      What of John Harland, the man? His generosity to those less fortunate,
      dedication to his church, and most of all, his concern for those who
      worked for him was limitless.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1971 Mr. Harland was honored for his long support of Boy&#146;s Club
      activities with the dedication of a Boy&#146;s Club bearing his name. Just
      last year he personally donated an indoor pool to the club.
    </p>

    <p>
      For years he served at St. Luke&#146;s Episcopal church in Atlanta as
      organist. Those close to him claim that age did not hinder his ability to
      sit at a piano or organ and pick a tune.
    </p>

    <p>But his company and his employees were his real joy.</p>

    <p>
      Until his recent illness and orders from his doctors to slow down, Mr.
      Harland came to the office practically every day.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many were amazed by the longevity of his career and would ask him why he
      hadn&#146;t retired when he reached 65. He would chuckle and in his Irish
      brogue inform the curious party that he was well past 65 when that company
      policy went into effect so he didn&#146;t think it applied to him.
    </p>

    <p>
      His employees were something special to him. For years, before the company
      opened any branches outside the Atlanta area, he knew every employee by
      name and would personally hand out the paychecks.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 1973 he showed further evidence of his concern for his employees and
      the great performance record they had attained. He gave away a million
      dollars worth of his own Harland stock to employees. It was truly an
      unselfish act and almost unprecedented in business history. News of his
      generosity went all across the country and he received letters from
      anonymous admirers. In fact, he even received one from Australia.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most visitors to his office would be treated to seeing one of his prized
      possessions&#151; a tattered copy of the original time book for his
      company&#146;s first ten employees. He would take it out and call
      attention to the number of hours and days in a work week, the names in the
      book, and the salary amounts, low by today&#146;s standards, but good
      wages in 1923.
    </p>

    <p>
      He would sit for hours at his desk looking over a computer printout that
      itemized the account of each employee in the Harland profit sharing plan.
      This plan was his pride and joy and an example of his business sense and
      feel for looking into the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      He realized his employees needed more than a static pension plan that had
      no room for growth. So, in 1959, he initiated the profit sharing plan.
      Since that time, the accounts have grown steadily without a single penny
      coming from an employee&#146;s paycheck. All money is generated from a
      yearly company contribution.
    </p>

    <p>That type of generosity typifies the man and the company he founded.</p>

    <p>
      But now, after 91 years of being blessed with having him among us, he is
      gone. He was blessed with a long and good life, and those fortunate enough
      to have known him were blessed by his Irish wit, his love, and his sincere
      concern for all.

      <b><a name="HarlanLincoln"></a>Update on Harlan-Lincoln House</b>
    </p>

        <td width="50%" height="400">
          <p>
            The former home of Senator James A. Harlan, whose daughter, Mary
            Eunice, married Robert Todd Lincoln, is undergoing renovation and
            preservation work. The home is part of Iowa Wesleyan College,
            located in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, location of the 1997 national
            Harlan reunion.<br />
          </p>

          <p>
            The house was built in 1860 and is now a museum with a collection of
            Harlan and Lincoln personal items and furnishings.
          </p>

          <p>
            The house sustained water and humidity damage in March of 2002. The
            State Historical Society of Iowa supplied an architect to survey the
            damage and make recommendations, including the removal of a 1931
            addition which was putting stress on the main structure. The
            property was regraded to promote proper drainage, and two out
            buildings were removed. Deteriorated trim was replaced, ceiling
            plaster repaired, the floor refinished and the west rooms and front
            hall were painted.
          </p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      A new heating, air conditioning and ventilation system was installed, and
      now the house has climate control which will help preserve the museum
      collection. A security system was also added for protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      A paint analysis determined that the original outside color of the house
      paint was pale yellow. Thanks to two foundation grants, the house will be
      repainted yellow with white trim.
    </p>

    <p>
      After the water damage in 2002, many books and framed artifacts were
      trucked to Chicago where they were air-dried and disinfected. A
      computerized inventory of the Harlan-Lincoln House collection has now been
      made, thanks to a volunteer from Iowa City.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mary Harlan Lincoln gave the college a fragment of the coat collar Abraham
      Lincoln was wearing when assassinated. The remainder of the coat, minus
      its left sleeve, is at Ford&#146;s Theatre in Washington, D.C. Several
      group and individual donations paid to have the collar piece properly
      mounted and framed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Long-range planning sessions have been held to decide the priority of
      issues that need to be resolved and how it will happen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Several events have taken place which are aimed to encourage using the
      Harlan-Lincoln House history as a resource for college students.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Harlan Family in America has donated to the cause in the past.
      Financial help from interested individuals will be greatly appreciated.

    <p>
      Thomas Henry Harland was born in 1868 in Pulaski County, Ill. He was a
      gifted musician and at one time, he had a radio program of country music
      known as &#147;Uncle Tom and his Fiddle.&#148;
    </p>

    <p>
      Thomas also loved band music and organized a band in every new town to
      which he and his family moved. He was an engineer on steamboats on the
      Mississippi and Ohio Rivers and once was the only person to hold an
      engineer&#146;s license on both salt and fresh water boats.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thomas&#146; wife, Bertha, played the cello and bass violin, and the
      couple and their three daughters formed a music group that entertained on
      showboats as they traveled up and down the rivers. Daughters Eva, Bess and
      Hazel played violin, piano, trumpet and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thomas&#146; line is George (#3), Aaron (#8), Samuel (#40), George (#189),
      George (#689), Thomas Cowlie, and James B. The name was spelled
      &#147;Harlan&#148; in Alpheus Harlan&#146;s genealogy book, but the family
      uses &#147;Harland.&#148;
    </p>

    <p>
      Thomas&#146; daughter Hazel was Becky Nufer&#146;s grandmother, and
      Becky&#146;s mother is Janice Smith Nufer.

        <b><a name="search"></a>Search and Research</b><br />

        by Cynthia Rhoades, Director of Genealogy
      </p>

    <p>
      There are so many wonderful resources today to use for research. Many
      times I hit a seemingly dead end but know there is a solution somewhere.
      The trick is to discover where and how to look. I was fortunate to have a
      very experienced person get me started. Otherwise I might still be
      floundering in Research 101.

      <br />

      <br />

      Recently a friend asked me to join her on an outing to a library in a town
      across the nearby state line. We share a common grandparent through
      marriage, so I agreed to go but didn&#146;t expect the day to be very
      fruitful. I was amazed at how much material was available at that
      particular library. Genealogy research has become so popular that
      libraries are branching out more and more to accommodate people searching
      for their ancestors. <br />

      <br />

      I was only prepared to look at one family line. It was my loss since the
      available material was so extensive. I promised myself I would print a
      family report on each line I am researching when I got home that day. That
      way when the opportunity is available I will have one of the necessary
      tools to look for information. When I work on a half a dozen different
      families I tend to get names, places and dates confused. Having a hard
      copy of the information can be a time saver if there is any doubt whether
      you have found the right person. <br />

      <br />

      That holds true whether you&#146;re working in a library, a courthouse or
      any other depository that keeps records. Another instance a while back
      allowed me a few minutes in the Clerk&#146;s Office in the courthouse. The
      Clerk&#146;s Office is an excellent resource. In my state, marriage
      records, wills, probate and records of that nature can be found there. Not
      having planned to even stop there I was totally unprepared to do any
      productive research. That was another instance when I wish I carried
      copies of my family tree(s) in the car all of the time. I haven&#146;t
      done so yet but think it&#146;s a great idea.
