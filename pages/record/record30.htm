        As Americans moved west, members of the Harlan family were often among
        the first pioneers to blaze new trails and open up the frontier. They
        would leave their family name on streams, mountains and hamlets across
        the land &#150; from a swamp in Maine to a rock off the Big Sur coast of
        California. They also left a wealth of family stories about those early
        <i>adventurers</i>.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        So it was that when my brothers and I were growing up in California, we
        heard the story of our great-grandfather Elisha (#2995) who, as a boy,
        came across the plains in a covered wagon. Along the way, he ignored his
        parents&#146; warning, leaned too far out of the wagon, fell out, and
        was run over. He also got to sleep under a buffalo robe!
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        As we got older, we read accounts of the &#147;Great Trek&#148; in a
        book by Elisha&#146;s cousin, Jacob Wright Harlan (#2984), titled
        <i>California &#146;46 to &#146;88</i>. It introduced us to our
        remarkable great-great-grandfather, George Harlan (#852), who led his
        extended family to California via a new route through the mountains and
        deserts of Utah and Nevada&#151;the Hastings Cut-Off. Because the
        Harlans traveled the same trail with the ill-fated Donner Party, our
        family&#146;s saga has become part of the lore of the West.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 2006, my brothers Jim and Dick and I decided to retrace George
        Harlan&#146;s trek along the Oregon, Hastings and California Trails. We
        drove over 1,600 miles from Kearney, Neb., to Sacramento, Calif., along
        interstates and over dirt roads, following the wagon train&#146;s
        circuitous route. As we zipped along at 70 miles an hour, we tried to
        envision moving in slow motion, making only 15 miles a day in a creaking
        wagon pulled by oxen. We tried to imagine 8 year-old Elisha&#146;s
        thoughts when he saw the same landmarks we now photographed. And,
        because we knew how the trip turned out, we speculated on 44-year-old
        George Harlan&#146;s success, versus George Donner&#146;s failure. Here
        area few of the high points from that memorable journey through time.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        After traveling hundreds of miles over the apparently featureless
        Nebraska prairie, we approached two rock towers, incongruously set in
        the middle of a plain near Bridgeport. Even though Courthouse and Jail
        Rocks are miles from the Oregon Trail, which here followed the south
        bank of the Platte River, we, like our ancestors, detoured to gawk at
        the sight.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Then we traveled for two days through the stark beauty of southern
        Wyoming, following the Harlans&#146; path as they approached the Rockies
        and labored over the Continental Divide at South Pass. Occasionally we
        saw pronghorn antelopes loping through the sagebrush and imagined the
        young men hunting for fresh meat to supply the weary travelers, who had
        now been on the trail for over three months. The country was magnificent
        but dry &#150; vast plains beneath snow-capped ranges. In place of
        buffalo herds, long trains carrying coal from the Powder River region
        rumbled by.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Finally we reached the oasis of Fort Bridger, in the southwest corner of
        the state. The emigrants&#146; accounts spoke of the many Indians and
        fur traders camped at the fort. Here they met Lansford Hastings, the
        incompetent trail guide with whom they entrusted their lives. With him,
        they left the Oregon Trail to blaze an unknown &#147;short-cut.&#148;
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The first week on the Hastings Cut-Off went reasonably well. They had to
        hack a trail through sagebrush and willows, but the terrain was fairly
        level. They entered Utah through the spectacular Echo Canyon with its
        red rock cliffs. Then the wagons reached the swift-flowing, cold waters
        of the Weber River, high on the plateau of the Wasatch Mountains. The
        emigrants knew they had to get down to the Great Salt Lake, but their
        guide was nowhere to be found! So George made his fateful decision and
        turned right to follow the river through its narrow gorge.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        As we zipped through the impossibly constricted canyon on Interstate 84,
        we passed some of the fearsome obstacles the Harlans had to overcome.
        They now had 57 wagons and a herd of cattle to get past Devil&#146;s
        Slide and under Devil&#146;s Eye! At one point it took them all day to
        go just one mile. The major barrier was Devil&#146;s Gate, a rock wall a
        few miles east of what is now Ogden, Utah. It was a sheer precipice, 75
        feet high, over which the Harlans hoisted those 57 wagons, one at a
        time. But highway and train construction in the gorge over the last 160
        years had reduced it to a fraction of its former size.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Donners reached the Weber River a few days after the Harlans, and
        they just stopped, waiting for someone to come and tell them which way
        to go. The delay proved fatal.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Looping south of the enormous lake of salt water the next day, we
        recalled what Hastings had told his weary charges: once they got to the
        salt flats they would be &#147;home free&#148; because the waterless
        surface could be traveled quickly. They were advised to travel at night
        because of the heat, and told that two nights and one day would get them
        over the waterless 40-mile expanse.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On a rise west of Skull Valley, near the last brackish waterhole where
        the emigrants had stocked up, we looked out over the gleaming surface of
        the flats and knew the dreadful truth. It was closer to 80 miles to the
        shimmering mecca of Pilots Peak on the Utah&#150;Nevada state line,
        where next potable water was to be found.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The heavy wagons sent up clouds of blinding dust and the wheels broke
        through the crust in places. But worst of all were the glare and the
        thirst. On the third day, the animals began to die or run mad. The
        emigrants had to unhitch the surviving oxen from the wagons and drive
        them the last 20 miles to the cold water springs on the mountainside,
        now 15 miles north of Wendover. It took three days to restore the
        animals sufficiently to go back and retrieve the wagons.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The same thing happened to the Donners, now several weeks back on the
        trail, but they had to leave several wagons, claimed by salt until
        archeologists excavated their remains over 100 years later.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        West of Pilot&#146;s Peak the emigrants pushed on, trying to reach the
        next major waterway, the Humboldt River, where the Hastings Cut-Off
        would rejoin the established California Trail. First, they faced the
        East Humboldt and Ruby Mountains. If the Harlans had had more time or a
        knowledgeable guide, they might have found a quicker way to traverse
        this next barrier, as the interstate does now. But they had neither. It
        was late in the season, and Hastings was about to leave them, so they
        started a 100-mile detour south around the mountains.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        We drove south along a dirt road at the base of the snowcapped peaks,
        the kind of lonely route where people came out from their isolated ranch
        houses to wave as we sped past. In places the late spring rains and
        melting snow had washed away the roadbed. We finally turned west to
        climb the steep eastern face of the Rubies on a narrow track. On the
        other side, we turned north to follow the Huntington Branch of the
        Humboldt River. In its narrow canyon, the current had swept one of the
        wagons away. We were struck by the magnificent vistas of the Rubies, but
        we breathed a little easier once we were across.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        West of Lovelock, Nev., we crossed another stretch of desert, then
        reached the Truckee River at Fernley. The emigrants said this was the
        toughest part because the animals and people were so exhausted. Hundreds
        of bodies have been found here, forlornly left in hastily scratched,
        shallow graves, a reminder that about a tenth of the emigrants perished
        on the trail.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Like the Harlans, we followed the river past what is now Reno and up
        into the Sierras. Higher and higher we climbed. The last part of the
        ascent, the snow-covered granite outcroppings of 7,000 foot Donner Pass,
        above the peaceful beauty of Donner Lake, seemed impossible for wagons
        and oxen to traverse. It must have taken the last bit of strength of
        people and animals to make it over. We smiled as we remembered how
        impressed we had been by Courthouse and Jail Rocks. They seemed like
        anthills compared with what we had since seen and climbed.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In a few days the Harlans would be able to look down on the welcoming
        confines of Sutter&#146;s Fort. The Donners, who had fallen behind,
        spent months starving at the lake, unable to make that last few miles
        before the snows.
      </p>

        />At the end of our journey, easy compared to theirs, we were glad to be
        home in a place our ancestors prepared for us in those heady days when
        they finished their Great Trek.

      />When Chris Harlin was 11, he offered to buy back the house his
      great-grandparents built from the owners, Gainesville, Mo., attorney
      Charlie Brown and his wife Penny. He offered them a dollar, and of course,
      they turned him down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2001, Chris tried again. This time it was a serious offer. He was CEO
      of the local bank. And other Harlin relatives<br />
      were in on the offer, including Chris&#146;s dad, John Layton Harlin, who
      remembered playing in the house as a kid. This time, the offer was
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house is now a mixture of family home, museum, and restaurant. The
      exterior has been restored as close as possible to how it looked when
      Chris&#146;s great-grandparents, John Conkin and Clara Layton Harlin built
      it in 1912, while the inside has been adapted to serve as a restaurant on
      the first floor and a family home upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inside walls are a gallery of family history, adorned with photos,
      keepsakes and the Harlin family coat of arms. Three dining rooms, as well
      as the dramatic wrap-around porch in nice weather, allow for elegant
      dining in a casual setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Missy, Chris&#146;s wife, is the restaurant manager, and Missy&#146;s
      brother, Aaron Workman, is the chef. Lunch is offered weekdays, and dinner
      on Friday nights. The house is located, appropriately, on Harlin Drive.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Harlin family&#146;s influence on this community goes well beyond
      preservation of a historic house and serving as hosts for a delicious
      meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chris Harlin&#146;s family line is as follows (numbers from the Alpheus
      Harlan book): George (#3); Aaron (#8); Samuel (#40); George (#189); Samuel
      Harling (#688); James Harling (#2319); John William Harlin; John Conkin
      Harlin (who built the house); Hugh Tan Harlin; John Layton Harlin; Chris
      Harlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Samuel (#688) was a farmer born in Union District, S.C., in 1778. He
      married Nancy Fitzpatrick around 1800, then moved to Monroe County, Ky.,
      in the south-central part of the state. His grandson, John William Harlin,
      married Mary Conkin and moved to Gainesville in 1869.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two of their sons, Jim and Tan, decided in 1894 to open a bank in
      Gainesville, as it was a business center and had no bank. Their brother
      John Conkin Harlin was first an assistant cashier and later the bank
      president. In 1912, he and his wife, Clara Layton Harlin, built the house
      that is now called the Old Harlin House Caf&eacute;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of the succeeding generations listed above &#150; Hugh, John L., and
      Chris &#150; has served as the bank&#146;s leader in turn. It is now
      called Century Bank of the Ozarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hugh Tan Harlin also honored his family&#146;s contributions by building
      an exact replica of the Harlin house, now on display at the bank. He also
      wrote and self-published a book on the family, titled The Harlins of Ozark
      County.
    </p>
    <p>

      house, now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. For more

      />Dear Harlan Family,
    </p>
    <p>
      On behalf of the Friends of the Harlan-Lincoln House at Iowa Wesleyan
      College, I want to express our gratitude to The Harlan Family in America
      for your support over the past ten years for our work to improve and
      develop the Harlan-Lincoln House. We are making steady progress. Your
      organization's membership and memberships from individual Harlan families
      has been important to our success.
    </p>
    <p>
      I invite you to come and see us. If you&#146;ve been here before, you will
      see significant changes. For example, Mary Harlan Lincoln&#146;s
      wrap-around porch has been reconstructed. Planning and fund raising for
      landscaping is now underway. Volunteers from the local Master Gardeners
      group have designed landscaping for the grounds using Victorian plantings.
      They tilled the soil last fall and will plant the first stage of the
      design around the House this spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The State Historical Society of Iowa has finished stabilizing the Civil
      War flag that is part of the Harlan-Lincoln House collection. The 3.5 foot
      by 8.5 foot flag was hand sewn by a group of women for Northern troops to
      carry into the Battle of Athens, Mo., (northernmost battle of the Civil
      War). Local Questers chapters and the Questers of Iowa provided funds to
      carry out the stabilization. The flag has been returned to the
      Harlan-Lincoln House. An open house to view the flag was held on Veterans
      Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Last year, two donations of Harlan-Lincoln memorabilia were made to the
      house. Betty Hickey of Elkhart, Ill., gave many valuable letters, books
      and personal objects, connecting the Lincolns with Sen. James Harlan. She
      is the widow of James Hickey, former curator of the Lincoln Collection at
      the Illinois State Historical Society. Mr. Hickey developed a friendship
      with Robert Todd Lincoln Beckwith, the last Lincoln descendant, and before
      his death in 1985, Beckwith gave the items to the Hickeys in appreciation
      of their longtime friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dean and Linda Hicks of Knoxville, Iowa, gave Jack Lincoln's pencil box.
      Abraham II or &#147;Jack&#148; Lincoln (1873-1890) was the son of Mary
      Eunice Harlan and Robert Todd Lincoln. During his childhood Jack spent
      many summers in Mt. Pleasant. On the underside of the lid an inscription
      reads &#147;Jacky Lincolns (sic) box. Given me by his mother Mrs. Mary
      Harlan Lincoln, 1896, Je.7.&#148; The inscription reads &#147;by Lizzie
      Arrow-smith,&#148; who according to local historian Donald Young, lived in
      Mount Pleasant and helped care for sick and dying soldiers at Camp Harlan,
      near Mt. Pleasant, during the Civil War.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an effort to raise funds and encourage continued strong associations
      with the Harlan-Lincoln House, miniatures of the House are available for
      $20&#150;$25. Contact me if you are interested in purchasing one of these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recent events organized by the Friends of the Harlan-Lincoln House have
      included two well-received campus presentations in October by C.J. King,
      author of Four Marys and a Jessie: The Story of the Lincoln Women.
      Hundreds of people attended, and copies of the book were sold out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In January, the Friends presented an exhibit by photo historian Paul C.
      Juhl that included works by the local Leisenring Brothers Studio, who took
      photos of the Harlans and the Lincolns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several brown bag lectures were offered in March, including one by Donald
      Young entitled &#147;The Story of Camp Harlan, Mount Pleasant&#146;s Civil
      War Training Camp.&#148; In mid April, we are hosting the Association of
      Lincoln Presenters&#146; national convention.

    <p>
      If you have never visited Mount Pleasant, we encourage you to come and
      experience life in small town Iowa. Please notify me ahead of time if you
      would like to come and tour the Harlan-Lincoln House, as we are open by
      appointment only.

      A new edition of the popular and previously out-of-print book by Jacob
      Wright Harlan is being reprinted in time for this summer&#146;s Harlan
      family reunion in Reno, Nevada.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Wright Harlan&#146;s California 1846-1888 is being published in its
      entirety. Also included in the book will be additional information on the
      Harlan family history. The repackaged book is titled Eyewitness to the
      Settlement of the West: Jacob Wright Harlan&#146;s California 1846-1888.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book is being published by Squire Cheyney Books with the cooperation
      of The Harlan Family in America. Part of the proceeds of each sale of the
      book through the Harlan family organization will be donated to The Harlan
      Family in America.<br />

    <p>
      Jacob Wright Harlan was born in Wayne County, Ind., on October 14, 1828,
      and died on March 7, 1902, in San Leandro, Calif. During his seven decades
      of life, Jacob took part in many of the historic events that led to the
      settlement of the West, including the gold rush and the fight for
      California independence. He was also a member of the Donner party. His
      eyewitness accounts of the settlement of the West are an important part of
      our nation&#146;s history.

      The evening was festive! About 40 of us (members of the Northwest Ohio Tai
      Chi society) had gathered at a restaurant to celebrate the Chinese New
      Year. Across the table from me was Aretta Adams, a member of my class and
      the person who makes sure attendance records are kept, takes our money,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we talked, the conversation turned to places where we had lived and
      then, how our ancestors came to this country. Aretta said, &#147;My
      ancestors came from England.&#148; My response, &#147;So did mine!&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, my friend said that they were originally from England but had spent
      about nine years in Ireland before coming to the U. S.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, I said, &#147;So did mine!!&#148; Aretta then asked my maiden name
      and when I said &#147;Harlan,&#148; she exclaimed, &#147;That was my
      grandmother&#146;s name!!!&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      When we discovered we were both in George&#146;s line, we went to the
      Alpheus Harlan book. Aretta descends from John, #208, and I, from Isaac,
      #207. How much fun we&#146;ve had with this discovery, how nice to call my

      <i
        >Editor&#146;s Note: Those of us who descend from George, Michael and
        Thomas Harland may never have considered that there were Harlans in
        other countries besides England and Ireland. Our German cousin, Ingrid
        Buchloh, offers a new perspective.<br />
        <br />
        Ingrid recently published a book on the German Huguenot Harlans, and
        while the book is in German, she has some summary information in English
        on her Web site: (<a href="http://www.i-buchloh.de">www.i-buchloh.de</a
        >). What follows is information from that Web site, plus general
        information about the Huguenots, about the author, and about ordering
        her book. (If anyone would like to pay for an English translation of any
        of this material, contact Antje Ruppert at: antje@sover.net.)</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The Harlans were farmers and citizens of Lille, France (70 miles southeast
      of Calais), from the 14th - 17th centuries. Jean Harlan and his two
      brothers became Huguenots. Huguenot was the name given to French
      Protestants in the 1500s. The Huguenots were persecuted as severely as any
      of the sects that broke from the Catholic Church. In the two centuries
      after 1517 and Martin Luther&#146;s famous revolt, many dissident sects
      broke with the Church, and much turmoil ensued.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Calvin helped increase the number of French Protestants. As their
      numbers grew, so did political opposition, and eventually several civil
      wars were fought in France. After much fighting, King Henri IV finally
      signed the Edict of Nantes in 1598, allowing religious freedom, but that
      freedom lasted less than a century. The edict was revoked in 1685 by Louis
      XIV, and during his reign, many Huguenots fled to other European countries
      and to North America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Harlan and his brothers left their homeland in 1685 after the
      abolition of the &#147;Edict of Nantes.&#148; One of them emigrated to
      South America and his descendants came to Philadelphia, where they became
      Quakers. The other two emigrated to Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Harlan established himself as manufacturer of tobacco in Schwedt
      (Brandenburg). His descendants contributed decisively to the economic
      development of the city and became members of the upper class. They were
      highly respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Harlan II, one of Jean Harlan&#146;s sons, went to Stolp (Pommern),
      where he and his descendants established themselves in the profitable
      amber business, which they later expanded into K&ouml;nigsberg in East
      Prussia. The East Prussian descendants found a new social role as lawyers,
      thus entering the higher ranks of civil servants. As officers they fought
      in the war of liberation against Napoleon and in the war against France
      1870-71. Although they emphasized their French cultural background and
      stuck to their French language, they proved themselves by contributing
      significantly to Prussia&#146;s economic growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ludwig Eduard Harlan went from K&ouml;nigsberg to Saxonia and made a
      fortune as a textile merchant in its capital, Dresden. He rose in the
      economic and social ranks with some help from the still functioning
      Huguenot network. His son Otto became the owner of a bank and consul of
      Columbia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The descendants of Otto&#146;s eldest son Walter became artists.
      Walter&#146;s son is the film director Veit Harlan, and his granddaughter
      Christiane is the wife of film director Stanley Kubrick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ingrid writes that, &#147;Even though these Harlans followed very
      different courses geographically, economically and socially, they all
      lived deliberately according to the French-Huguenot tradition. Up to the
      beginning of the 19th century, they were deeply rooted in their Huguenot
      faith. Their religious heritage prompted high ethical values and a broad
      tolerance towards other beliefs.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ingrid studied history and French language at university and wrote a
      doctoral thesis about the National Socialist Party&#146;s seizure of power
      in 1933-34. But she is also very interested in family history, especially
      the Harlans on her mother&#146;s side. &#147;My grandmother and her sister
      told me much about this family. So I also knew that we were related to the
      Dresden Harlans,&#148; she writes. &#147;I contacted them and subsequently
      received extensive material on this branch of the family.
    </p>
    <p>Later I tried to find some members of the French family.</p>
    <p>
      &#147;Returning from a journey to Paris, I had a stopover at Santes, from
      where the Harlans originated. There I found Jean Marie Bourrez, a member
      of the French Harlan family, who had pursued genealogical research for 30
      years and had tracked the Harlans back into the 14th century. Thereafter I
      began to collect further information in archives and by interviewing a lot
      of family members.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#147;From the American Harlans I heard that there was a connection
      between General Josiah Harlan [Harlan Record, Fall 2004, &#147;The Man Who
      Would Be King&#148;] and Gottlieb Ephraim Harlan, my ancestor. They became
      acquainted in 1841 in K&ouml;nigsberg, when the general stayed there for
      some days before going to St. Petersburg in Russia. They found out that
      they were cousins and remained in contact for some time by letters.&#148;

    <p>
      With the death of <b>Pat McCurdy</b>, of Tulsa, Okla., the Harlan Family
      lost a special lady, a wonderful friend, supporter and photographer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat first met her Harlan &#147;cousins&#148; in New Castle, Del., in 1987
      and attended every Harlan reunion until 2002 when health problems
      interfered. She so had her heart set on attending the 2007 Reno reunion,
      and it was the focus of her conversations. Pat traveled with the Harlans
      to England on each trip, and it was on the first trip in 1994, she became
      our &#147;official&#148; photographer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pat adored her Harlan family, and those who knew her, adored her also. She
      befriended everyone she met and would light up a room with her beautiful
      smile, Oklahoma drawl, happy and cheerful attitude. She will be terribly
      missed by her friends and family, as well as her animal family in Safari
      Park. &#151;Becky Hines, IN

        The Harlan Family in America wishes to say &#147;Thank You&#148; and
        expresses deep gratitude to Esther Harlan Wells of Indiana for her
        contribution to the Harlan association in the genealogy field.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        In 1996, while attending the Indiana Harlan Family Reunion, Esther
        decided to take on the task of gathering genealogy updates to Alpheus
        Harlan&#146;s book,
        <i>The History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family in America</i>,
        originally published in 1914. This was a tremendous task for Alpheus in
        the late 1880s and early 1990s, and Esther wanted to continue Harlan
        Family lines by keeping records of the family history. Through the
        Harlan Family&#146;s newsletter and its Web site, she asked Harlan-kin
        to send their updated information to her which she entered on a
        database.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        This has been a &#147;labor of love&#148; for Esther. She has obtained a
        great number of updates and even brought copies of them to the 2002
        Reunion. The time and effort that Esther has put into this project has
        been a wonderful gift to the Harlan Family.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Due to health issues, Esther has recently turned this project over to
        Fred J. Harlan of Pennsylvania. You may reach him at:<br />

        May Day Sing - May 6<br />
        58th Harlan Reunion - October 7
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        On the first Sunday of May each year, the descendants of Dr. Isaiah
        Harlan gather at the Blue Ridge Baptist Church along with its church
        members to join in the Annual May Day Sing. This year&#146;s service
        will be May 6, begin at 10:00 a.m. and break for lunch at noon. The
        afternoon will end with the semi-annual cemetery association meeting.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The first Sunday of October, October 7, has been set for the weekend
        when Harlan descendants will gather for their 58th Annual Harlan Family
        Reunion. While descendants of Dr. Isaiah Harlan have called Blue Ridge
        Baptist Church home since land for the church was deeded in 1873 by Dr.
        Harlan&#146;s son, George Harlan, many more Harlans also came to Texas.
        In the spirit of &#147;family,&#148; we hope all Harlans in Texas will
        join us for a day of worship and reunion.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Blue Ridge Baptist Church is located about ten miles east of Marlin,
        Texas, on FM 1771.
