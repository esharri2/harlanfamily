        <b>George &amp; Michael Harland: The Irish Interlude</b>
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Having sailed from Belfast, Ireland, the founders of the Harlan Family
        in America, George and Michael Harland, arrived in William Penn&#146;s
        Quaker colony on the Delaware in America in 1687. Although they were
        born in England, near the City of Durham in the Bishopric (Episcopate)
        of Durham, they did not come here directly. Prior to leaving for
        America, they spent a period, perhaps 15 years, living near Lurgan,
        County Armagh, Northern Ireland. It is this Irish interlude I wish to
        consider. This article attempts to explain why they went to Ireland; why
        specifically to Lurgan; how it was that they could take up land there,
        to which native Irish presumably had prior claims; why they decided to
        go to William Penn&#146;s American colony; and how their peregrinations
        fitted into the larger picture of what was going on in Ireland and the
        world at large, at the time.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Answering these questions involves constructing a sort of snapshot of
        what was going on in the world in 1687, outlining the relevant events
        leading up to that date, and where necessary, indicating what happened
        later. My model for this approach is John E. Wills: 1688: A Global
        History, which drew together events in a single year in the 17th
        century, and described what was happening at that particular time all
        over the world. The scope of my account is less ambitious, but follows a
        similar plan.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <b>The World in 1687</b><br />
        Great events were unfolding in England and the world at large during the
        17th century, but my guess is that the brothers&#146; intellectual
        horizon was quite constricted, and that the great sweep of world history
        left them untouched, untroubled and uninterested. They were probably
        already in Ireland when France&#146;s Louis XIV revoked the Edict of
        Nantes in 1685, thereby revoking the freedom to worship earlier granted
        to the French Protestants (Huguenots). The arrived in America the same
        year that Robert LaSalle died while working his way down the Ohio,
        Missouri and Mississippi rivers, establishing the claim of France to
        large tracts of territory in North America. The Thirty Years War, the
        Franco-Spanish War, and the Anglo-Dutch Wars, which had raged earlier in
        the century, were of little concern to them, and catastrophes like the
        Great Plague of London in 1665 and the Great Fire in 1666 would have
        seemed quite remote.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <b>Irish History</b><br />
        Since we are concerned with the brothers&#146; sojourn in Ireland, some
        understanding of the story of that island is important. The ethnicity
        and culture of England had been repeatedly modified by invasion since
        Roman times, and although similar considerations applied to Ireland,
        remoteness had its advantage, and the native Celts were better insulated
        than their English neighbors from foreign influences. The genetic makeup
        of the modern Irish is predominantly that of their Celtic ancestors. The
        Irish suffered many military defeats over the years, but the country was
        never subjugated to the extent that the majority of its citizens became
        quietly resigned to foreign rule. The history is complicated, but for
        our purposes, we may summarize events this way.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The Vikings had invaded Ireland in the 9th century and then the
        Anglo-Normans (themselves of Viking ancestry) came in the 12th.
        England&#146;s Henry VIII declared himself King of Ireland in 1541, and
        the Tudors made significant land grants to favorites of the Crown. Irish
        peasants were tenant farmers of these manor lands until the reign of
        Elizabeth (1558-1603), when efforts were made to import substantial
        numbers of English settler-tenants. The incomers for the most part lived
        inside the &#147;pales&#148; or boundaries of the cities of Waterford,
        Cork, Limerick, and Dublin. Not surprisingly, the natives resented their
        presence, and there were rebellions in 1559, 1569 and 1594. The last of
        these, led by Hugh O&#146;Neill, Earl of Tyrone, continued to 1603 and
        is remembered as the Nine Years War. During the conflict both sides
        practiced scorched earth tactics, and the Irish countryside was laid
        waste by fire, sword and famine.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Ultimately, the rebels were defeated, and peace was declared by
        England&#146;s King James I at the Treaty of Mellifont in 1603. The
        Earls were allowed to regain control of their lands by surrendering them
        to the Sovereign, who then graciously re-granted them. By agreeing to
        this, the Earls acknowledged the supremacy of the Crown. But Tyrone and
        his associates had created too many enemies for this to settle matters,
        and among the English authorities were those relentlessly plotting their
        downfall. Troops commanded by Earl of Tyrone had killed the brother of
        Sir Arthur Chichester, and the latter, now Lord Deputy of Ireland, was
        engaged in a personal vendetta against the Earl. By the summer of 1607
        the Earl felt that he was in imminent danger of arrest, imprisonment,
        and execution. Together with about a hundred others, he boarded ship and
        fled the country. Things might have been different had the Earl ever
        fulfilled his intended desire to return, but instead he died in exile in
        Rome in 1616.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        <b>The Ulster Plantation</b><br />
        At the end of the 16th Century, of all the Irish Provinces, Ulster,
        (basically the northern part of the island), remained the most Celtic in
        tradition, laws, religion and ethnicity. Although the number of folk who
        sailed with the Earls was very modest, the Flight of the Earls proved to
        be pivotal in Irish history because it was the catalyst that transformed
        Ulster into the least Irish of its Provinces. The event could be
        considered as the beginning of an Irish diaspora, which in later years
        was to dramatically reduce the population of the island.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        The vacuum left by the departure of O&#146;Neill and O&#146;Donnell gave
        the authorities the excuse to confiscate their lands, roughly speaking
        the counties of Derry, Fermanagh and Armagh, and to neuter further
        threat of Irish rebellion by &#147;planting&#148; the escheated
        territory with great numbers of Scots and English dissenters. In his
        capacity as King of Scotland, James I was glad to see the back of many
        of his less law-abiding citizens, and by transporting these folk across
        the Irish Sea, the authorities in England and Scotland killed two birds
        with one stone &#151; at a stroke they disencumbered themselves of
        lawless Scottish Lowlanders and troublemaking English dissenters, while
        establishing on the seized lands a population who would offer a rabidly
        Protestant bulwark against the indigenous Irish Catholic inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        As an added bonus the Crown made money by selling off large tracts of
        land to &#147;undertakers,&#148; who committed to attracting a specified
        number of settlers as tenants or leaseholders within a specified time
        and to building lightly fortified forts or &#147;bawns&#148; with arms
        and powder for their defense.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        Some of the dispossessed Irish were killed or transported as slaves to
        the West Indies, while others took to the hills to survive as rapparees,
        descending on the newcomers&#146; farms when opportunity offered. Some
        remained to work as laborers for their new masters, but they did not do
        so happily, and this was to have repercussions in 1641.

        />Of significance to Harlan Family history is an area in northeast
        Armagh, near the modern town of Lurgan. This was part of the Barony of
        Oneilland, confiscated from the O&#146;Neill clan in 1607 and ceded to
        the Brownlow family as undertakers. This area was settled largely with
        English, as distinct from Scottish, planters, and remarkably, to this
        day, dialectologists can detect traces of this difference in background
        in the speech of folk of this particular area. Surviving records
        indicate that tenants on the Brownlow estate included Peter Harland,
        townland of Ballyblagh in 1635, and John Harland, townland of Liscorran
        in 1659. (These townlands are now totally overbuilt and incorporated in
        the town of Lurgan.) Peter is listed on a Muster Roll as
        &#147;pikeman,&#148; and this together with the early dates suggest that
        he was not a Quaker, at least not then. If, as seems probable from the
        family name, they were related to the brothers, then their prior
        presence in the area is another reason why the later arrivals chose to
        settle near Lurgan.

    <p>
      Mark your calendars for the next national reunion to be held at John
      Ascuaga&#146;s Nugget Hotel in Reno, Nev., from July 11&#150;15, 2007. We
      are excited to hold our first national reunion in the western states.
      There are many things to do in the Reno/Lake Tahoe area, so plan your
      vacation time around it. If you visit the following:<br />
      &lt;
      <a href="http://www.visitrenotahoe.com">www.visitrenotahoe.com</a> &gt;

      &gt;<br />
      and use a search engine, you&#146;ll find informative sites to help you
      plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been given the following data from John Ascuaga&#146;s Nugget
      Hotel: room rates have been quoted as $89, single or double occupancy,
      plus 13.5% room tax. Triple and quad occupancy is an additional $10 each,
      with a hotel guarantee that the rate will be no more than $95, single or
      double occupancy. Please note that the actual room rate may be lower then
      the guarantee. There are other lodging options such as campgrounds, motor
      home parks, and lower priced motel rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The annual board meeting of The Harlan Family in America will be held
      April 23, 2005, at the Clarion Hotel in Sacramento, Calif., with the main
      topic being the 2007 national reunion. Daily reunion activities will be
      discussed, and reunion volunteer committees will be organized.
    </p>
    <p><b>How can you help make this another successful reunion?</b></p>
    <p>
      We have had a good response for volunteers in our first appeal last year
      but will need many more. We&#146;re also looking to add to our mailing
      list so more Harlan family members can be reached. If you know of others
      who do not now receive the newsletter, please let them know about the
      forthcoming reunion and urge them to sign up to receive reunion
      information as it becomes available.

    <p>
      Harlan Record co-editor C. J. King&#146;s four-generation biography of the
      Harlan-Lincoln women will be unveiled just in time for the Hildene
      symposium this summer. It will soon be available on the

    </p>
    <p>
      King has been researching and writing her book, Four Marys and a Jessie:
      The Story of the Lincoln Women, for several years, ever since she learned
      that she is related to these women through the Harlan family. After
      visiting Hildene, the Lincoln family home in Manchester, Vt., she decided
      to move to Vermont to begin this research. She now lives in Jamaica, Vt.
    </p>
    <p>
      A native Hoosier and the daughter of Raymond and Melba Harlan King of
      Indianapolis, she holds a degree in journalism from Ball State University
      and an MFA in writing from the University of Massachusetts. As a
      professional writer for 25 years, she has published many articles in
      newspapers and magazines. This is her first book.<br />

        A December 23 article by Ron Jennings of The Sedalia (Mo.) Democrat
        newspaper featured Bob Harlan as he made rounds of a local hospital
        disguised as Santa Claus.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        For five years, Bob has visited hospitalized children and new mothers,
        but this year he expanded his role to include everyone in the Bothwell
        Regional Health Center. In exchange for filling Santa&#146;s role at a
        Russell Stover Candies Store and the Salvation Army, he received candy
        and gifts to distribute to patients at Christmas time and was rewarded
        with many smiles and bright eyes.
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        He was quoted as saying, &#147;I don&#146;t care if they&#146;re three
        or 93, they all could use a little Santa Claus.&#148; Incidentally, he
        sports a real white beard, and the photos in the newspaper portray an
        authentic looking Santa enjoying his role.<br />

        Bob is a third-generation retired meat cutter from Green Ridge, Mo.

      <b><a name="widow"></a>Widow Makes Unusual Discovery</b><br />
      By Renee Duncan-Cortez
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years I have researched my family&#146;s heritage. After my
      husband, Brad Lake, passed away in 1995 at age 40, I wanted to include his
      family&#146;s history in my database for our two children, Brad, Jr., and
      Judy Raeann.
    </p>
    <p>
      I could not help but notice that my husband&#146;s ancestors had been
      Quakers and had lived in the same location as my family&#146;s roots. Then
      I came across the name of Elizabeth Duck, and my heart began to pound
      because it looked like the association was more than a friendship&#151;it
      was looking more like family.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a long story short, we indeed have family ties going back more
      than 300 years. I descend from Hannah Harlan Hollingsworth #6, and Brad
      descended from Aaron Duck Harlan #8.
    </p>
    <p>
      I find it amazing that in this vast world we live in, two people (George
      #3 and his wife, Elizabeth) who started their family in Ireland, would
      have two descendants who met and married on the far western side of the
      United States (Clovis, Calif.). And our two children have double lineage
      to the Harlan and Duck families.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now live in Denver, Colo., with my husband, Robert Cortez, and daughter,
      Veronica, but I&#146;m still very close with Brad&#146;s family. I now
      call my mother-in-law &#147;cousin,&#148; and we have a laugh.

    <p>
      The Harlan name is scattered across America. I am not referring to names
      of people (although we are scattered) but rather names of places. There
      are mountains, ditches, roads, counties and buildings. Last year, while
      visiting &#147;home&#148; in California, I was discussing family history
      with my cousin Bill Harlan (William K. Harlan). He suggested starting to
      compile a list of Harlan place names.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is a new link on the Web site of The Harlan Family in America,
      known as &#147;Harlan Place Names.&#148; <br />
      &lt;
      <a href="../places.htm">http://www.harlanfamily.org/places.htm</a> &gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      The list you will find at the Web site includes place names in the 50
      United States. Place names could be geographic (a mountain) or political
      (a city or county). The list includes the place name, state, county, more
      specific location if available, and history such as with whom the name
      originated. For example, you will see Harlan Avenue in Fresno County,
      California. Harlan Avenue was named for my great-grandfather, Elisha
      Harlan (#2995), who homesteaded in that area in the 1860s.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      This list is not definitive, and we want it to continue to grow with help
      from relatives and researchers everywhere. Please feel free to send
      additional names, corrections to existing information, or additional
      information on existing names. Send information to me by e-mail or postal
      mail. As the list is updated, I will send it to the Junior Harlan so the
      Web site can be updated.

      A new Web site full of Harland history opens with the above words. This
      Web site, organized by Webmaster Robin Harland of Belfast, Northern
      Ireland, includes pictures and genealogical information about the
      descendants of John Harland, a tenant farmer in the Armagh region of
      Northern Ireland, an area that we also explore in the article, &#147;Irish
      Interlude,&#148; in this issue of the Harlan Record (page 1).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Web site reports the history of just one single family, one of very
      many examples of the Irish diaspora. The family&#146;s home was: Hillside,
      29 Convent Hill, BESSBROOK, Co. Armagh. Pictures of the home and some more
      recent ones of the family&#146;s descendants are on the Web site, found
      at: <a href="http://www.harlanddiaspora.net">www.harlanddiaspora.net</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#147;It starts with the story of the Harlands in Ireland from 1635, but
      the main part of the site concerns a single family unit that spread out
      all round the world &#133; Although only one very tiny part of the whole,
      some of the cousins may find some interest in these pages,&#148; Webmaster
      Robin writes.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do these Irish Harlands relate to the brothers who left England, spent
      some time in Ireland, and eventually ended up in America? Check out this
      Web site, read our ongoing installments of John H. Harland&#146;s
      &#147;Irish Interlude,&#148; which will be published in several issues of
      the Harlan Record, and let&#146;s see what we can find out.<br />
      <br />
      <i
        >(Editor&#146;s Note: Robin is the younger brother of John Harland,
        author of &#147;Irish Interlude.&#148; They may descend from Thomas,
        elder brother of George and Michael, who chose to remain in Ireland in
        1687, although some of his descendants eventually came to America. This
        is speculation, however, as other Harlands were in the Lurgan area at
        that time.)</i

      <b><a name="more"></a>More Than One Tragedy for First Lady McKinley</b
      ><br />
      Submitted by Steven Coulter
    </p>
    <p>
      I notice the Harlan Web site features a page on our cousin Ida Saxton
      (#10368), wife of President William McKinley, who was assassinated in
      1901. Three years earlier, his brother-in-law&#146;s killing resulted in
      one of the noted murder cases in Ohio&#146;s legal annals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ida Saxton McKinley&#146;s only brother, George Dewalt Saxton (#10370),
      was a well-to-do ladies&#146; man. He never married. Rather, he enjoyed
      other men&#146;s wives. So it came as no great surprise when George was
      found dead at age 47 in 1898, with four bullets in his body. According to
      the coroner&#146;s report, two of the shots didn&#146;t hit any vital
      organs. The third bullet caused a fatal wound, but the victim might have
      lived as long as 24 hours if not for the fourth bullet, which severed a
      major artery. George bled to death within just a few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      President and Mrs. McKinley were headed to the 1898 Trans-Mississippi
      Exposition at Omaha, Neb., but their train was detoured to Canton, Ohio,
      so they could attend George Saxton&#146;s funeral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real surprise came when the suspected killer turned out not to be a
      jealous husband, but rather Mrs. Annie George, one of the dead man&#146;s
      conquests. When Annie found out George was two-timing her, she gave him
      the &#147;Frankie and Johnny&#148; treatment.* You might think the crime
      was an open-and-shut case, with a noose waiting on a scaffold for the
      jealous adulteress. The prosecutor, Atlee Pomerene, was a competent
      attorney who later became a United States senator from Ohio. However,
      clever defense attorney James Sterling secured a sympathetic jury who
      found poor Annie &#147;not guilty.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      First Lady Ida McKinley survived her husband by only five years, dying in
      1907 in Canton, Ohio. She and her two young daughters rest with the
      martyred President in the McKinley Memorial adjacent to West Lawn Cemetery
      at Canton. Ida&#146;s other surviving sibling, Mary Belinda Saxton Barber,
      died ten years later, in 1917.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am the 6th cousin, three times removed, of Ida, Mary, and George Saxton.
      My Harlan connection, through my mother, was Hannah Harlan Hayes, daughter
      of Ezekiel Harlan, Jr., son of Ezekiel Harlan, son of George Harlan the
      American immigrant. By coincidence, through my father, Fred Coulter,
      President William McKinley was my 2nd cousin, three times removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      * &#147;Frankie and Johnny&#148; is one of the most popular and enduring
      American folk ballads. It tells the story of Frankie, the young woman who
      catches her lover with another woman and shoots him with her .44,
      &#147;rat-a-tat-tat,&#148; because &#147;he done her wrong.&#148; Frankie
      claimed self-defense, and a jury found her not guilty of murder.

    <p>
      Reprinted from the National Education Association&#146;s NEA Today, Oct.
      2004<br />
      by Donna Chiu
    </p>
    <p>
      Ever since Washington state teacher Sara Harlan spent a year living and
      teaching in Haiti, she has not been able to get the picture of the more
      than 300,000 abandoned and abused Haitian street children off her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she told her fourth-grade students about her experiences in Haiti,
      she set in motion an effort that touched everyone involved. &#147;I was
      telling my class about the hardships the street children in Haiti were
      facing, and the kids in my class just asked, &#145;What can we do to
      help?&#146;&#148; Harlan says, &#147;I didn&#146;t put any ideas in their
      heads.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Together, Harlan and her students brainstormed ways to raise money and
      finally decided to host a Read-a-thon, a one-month event conducted by five
      fourth-grade classes that raised more than $1,500 in pledges. In addition
      to the awareness effort she launched at her school, Harlan also alerted
      her community to the situation in Haiti by donating all $1,000 of the
      proceeds from her 2003 art show to Haitian Street Kids, Inc., a nonprofit
      charitable organization that provides children in Haiti with a home and
      the opportunity for a good education.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Harlan&#146;s generosity did not stop there. As the new librarian at
      Stanwood Middle School in Stanwood, Washington, Harlan has already held a
      fund-raiser to help a sister school in Guatemala open up a new library and
      has plans to hold another fund-raiser this year to continue helping
      Haitian street children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#147;Awareness is the most important thing,&#148; says Harlan. &#147;I
      can&#146;t possibly raise all the money necessary to help the children who
      need it, but if I can raise awareness with other people, then that&#146;s
      how compassion begins to snowball.&#148;

      The recently released book,

      setting up accounts, securing funds, devising winning strategies and
      participating in tournaments. It was written for people who are generally
      familiar with poker, but not as comfortable with the nuances of online
      play.

      www.harlanfamily.org &gt; under &#147;<a href="../stories.htm">Stories</a
      >&#148; where you will find information about his participation in the
      1998 GTE Big Ride Across America, a group bicycle ride from Seattle,
      Wash., to Washington, D.C. which benefited the America Lung Association.
      He selected an &#147;honorary buddy&#148; for the undertaking&#151;Joe
      Loft of Clarence, Mo.&#151;who was a childhood friend of Mark&#146;s
      father and was suffering from lung disease.

      Mark has spent 20 years in the Silicon Valley, working on various projects
      including Apple&#146;s Macintosh computer, the Sony MagicLink, the
      Motorola Envoy, early versions of the Netscape Navigator Web Browser and
      the T-Mobile Sidekick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark&#146;s biggest claim to fame is all but unknown to the public. One
      day over lunch, his friend Pierre Omidyar, asked Mark if he had an idea
      for how bidding might work in online auctions. As a child, Mark often went
      to police bicycle auctions, so the task was familiar and intriguing. He
      diagrammed the entire bidding process on the back of a place mat for
      Pierre, making special emphasis of the &#147;proxy&#148; technique (i.e.
      being able to bid while not being present). Pierre took the design, coding
      it exactly for use in a product called &#147;Action Web.&#148; The
      software matured, was renamed, and yet this exact bidding system is still
      being used by millions of people every day, now under the name of
      &#147;eBay.&#148;

      <b><a name="May"></a>May Day Singing in Texas</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The annual May Day Singing at Blue Ridge Baptist Church is set for Sunday,
      May 1, 2005. The church is located on FM-1771, about 10 miles east of
      Marlin, Texas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event starts at 10:00 a.m. with a prayer and short sermonette,
      followed by hymn singing until noon. A covered dish dinner will follow,
      with drinks and meats furnished. Attendees are asked to bring a salad,
      vegetable or dessert.<br />
      Hymn-singing resumes after dinner and will continue as long as singers and
      musicians are there. Any musicians and vocal performers are welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blue Ridge Baptist Church and the adjoining cemetery were established by
      descendants of Dr. Isaiah Harlan, #712, (1798-1847) on Mexican land
      granted during the days of Republic of Texas.

      <b><a name="friends"></a>Friends of the Harlan-Lincoln House Promotion</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Iowa Wesleyan College and the Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation Committee of
      Mt. Pleasant, Ia., launched the &#147;Friends of the Harlan-Lincoln
      House&#148; last September. The Friends organization was initiated as a
      way to support the mission &#147;to preserve the Harlan-Lincoln House and
      its collection&#148; and &#147;to fulfill the home&#146;s vital role in
      the living history of the College and the Community.&#148; To date,
      memberships have raised approximately $15,000.
    </p>
    <p>
      One may become a member at different levels of giving, starting at $30 for
      an individual or $50 for a family. To qualify as a charter member of
      Friends of the Harlan-Lincoln House, you may join at the $500 level before
      May 31, 2005. Charter members will receive a print of the Harlan-Lincoln
      House designed by Susan S. Johnston and will be recognized on a permanent
      plaque displayed in the Harlan-Lincoln House. For more information on
      joining Friends, contact Johanna Chapman at 800-582-2383.
    </p>
    <p>
      The current project at the Harlan-Lincoln House is raising funds to
      reconstruct the wrap-around porch Mary Harlan Lincoln had built in 1895.
      Architect Cooper Norman of Prairie Architects, Inc., has prepared
      specifications that include handicapped accessibility. Twelve feet wide,
      the porch is estimated to cost $75,000. In Norman&#146;s words, &#147;The
      addition of the porch . . . added grace to the otherwise austere massing
      of the house, and the open gesture it made to the college community must
      have been perceived as an invitation to come sit a while, to engage in
      conversation and open thoughtfulness with respected members of the
      community.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Funds from Friends memberships and from the support of two local family
      foundations will go toward the porch project, but additional funds are
      needed to move forward with bids for the project.
    </p>

      <b><a name="hurricane"></a>Hurricane Survivor Shares Experience</b><br />
      <i
        >Editor&#146;s Note: An inquiry in the Fall 2004 Harlan Record brought a
        response from Hazel Allee Burns (George Harlan #3, Ezekiel #5, William
        #22, Stephen #115, Stephen #465, Enoch #1656, Malinda Ann Harlan Allee
        #4644, Levi Austin Allee, Victor Millard Allee, Hazel Allee Burns), who
        tells about living through last fall&#146;s hurricanes:</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      My hometown, Fort Pierce, Fla., was struck head-on by Hurricane Frances,
      and then just three weeks to the day, we were struck again by Hurricane
      Jeanne! I&#146;ve lived in Florida for 51 years, and Frances and Jeanne
      were my first experiences with hurricanes. The last big hurricane to hit
      Fort Pierce was in 1949, and we are right on the Atlantic Ocean!
    </p>
    <p>
      The days just before Frances, we spent battening down in preparation. That
      meant bringing in anything that might fly around from the high winds, and
      rushing to the store to stock up on drinking water and easily prepared
      foods. Most of my neighbors boarded up their windows. I didn&#146;t. I had
      no hurricane shutters, and there was no way that I, a 79-year-old widow,
      could cut and nail plywood over the 13 windows and the large double door
      that leads from the family room to the courtyard.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday morning, October 4, it was breezy when we woke up, and by
      10:20 a.m. the power went off. By that time, several of my neighbors
      headed out for what they thought were safer locations. A trip to Orlando
      usually takes about two hours, but those who went there spent 10 hours in
      bumper-to-bumper traffic in high winds on the Turnpike. My little English
      Springer Spaniel, Max, and I just hunkered down and listened to the
      battery-powered radio, and I later spent the night&#151;as the winds
      picked up&#151;reading by flashlight. Our telephone service remained on
      throughout the storm, so I was able to check with friends who stayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winds increased in strength until they were howling over our heads at
      100mph. It was about that time that the big palm tree in my back yard fell
      over. It just missed the house by six feet. (Did you know that insurance
      doesn&#146;t pay for the removal or replacement of trees unless they
      damage the house? I didn&#146;t.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally at 2:00 a.m. the eye passed over Fort Pierce, so I was able to
      sleep for two hours until the winds picked up again at 4:00 a.m. The south
      side of the storm wasn&#146;t nearly as severe as the earlier winds from
      the north. By daybreak we were able to survey the damage. The powers that
      be looked after me&#151;I had only $2,600 damage: most of the screen over
      the courtyard was lost, one small window was broken, and a 10-foot
      decorative brick wall was destroyed. Food in the refrigerator and freezers
      began to spoil, but Max and I were fit and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following Frances, we had no power for 11 days, no water at all for two
      days (they had a boil-water order for about a week), no cable for 15 days,
      no newspaper for several days, and we were under a curfew from dusk to
      dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little did we know that an even stronger storm was on its way. Jeanne was
      a Category 3 hurricane, and she had winds up to 120 mph. The worst of it
      also hit at night. I held on and prayed the roof would hold. It did, but I
      spent all night mopping up rain that was driven under the family room door
      and the patched-up window in the bedroom. Little enough price to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was extensive damage in our town. Many houses had major damage, and
      2,400 had to be condemned. That&#146;s a lot in a town with only 35,000
      people. Many of the schools had enormous damage, and the kids were out of
      school for 20 days. One of the worst things in the aftermath is that all
      our traffic signals were out for a time.

    <p><b>Let Your Eyes Do the Walking</b></p>
    <p>
      When I find a new idea I always wonder why I didn&#146;t think of that
      before. Spending time wandering through cemeteries looking for family
      stones can be very time consuming. Taking a pair of binoculars along to
      help you search for those elusive gravestones can save a lot of time.
      Although you can&#146;t see and read all of the stones at one time (unless
      it&#146;s a very small cemetery) you can at least scan large areas and
      cover a lot of ground at a much faster pace. Talk about a time saver!
      Whereas the phone company suggests letting &#147;your fingers do the
      walking,&#148; in this case you can let &#147;your eyes do the
      walking.&#148;
