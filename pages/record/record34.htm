            Era
          </h2>
          <h4>by John G. Nickum</h4>
          <p>
            History becomes more interesting when there is a personal connection
            to events and/or people from the past. Likewise, genealogy takes on
            new life when it leads to connections to historical figures and
            events. I enjoy researching my family roots and the discovery of
            connections to historical events and people who previously had been
            nothing more than names in the history books. As I have traced these
            family roots, I have found individuals and events that produced
            feelings of pride in being related to them. I have also found people
            and situations that were less than honorable. I have adopted the
            statement that, &ldquo;I take neither credit, nor blame for my
            ancestors and their relatives.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            My professional specializations in the fields of zoology and
            microbiology are fish culture, fish health, and fishery management.
            These specialties are not the material of great moments in world
            history. I never expected to find a family connection to something
            of historical importance within even fisheries history, let alone
            national or world history. But, the railcar building firm of Harlan
            and Hollingsworth provided a connection to one of the better known
            periods in the history of fish culture and fisheries management in
            the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            A period of time from 1870 to the end of World War II is known as
            the &ldquo;Fish Car Era.&rdquo; What was the &ldquo;Fish Car
            Era,&rdquo; and how does it relate to the firm of Harlan and
            Hollingsworth? First, let&rsquo;s look at the Fish Car Era.
          </p>
          <p>
            When European settlers first arrived in America, fish and game
            supplies seemed unlimited. However, by the mid-19th century, it was
            clear that habitat destruction, pollution, dams, and unregulated
            exploitation had taken a serious toll on fish and wildlife
            populations. In addition, people from the eastern United States had
            moved west in large numbers. Many of these former
            &ldquo;easterners&rdquo; longed for fish they had enjoyed in the
            East. The result was a political decision to replenish depleted fish
            populations with hatchery-reared fish and to transplant native
            eastern fish to western waters. Some western fish, such as the
            rainbow trout, were transplanted to the East.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first attempt to transport fish from coast to coast occurred in
            1873, when Dr. Livingston Stone of the U.S. Fish Commission loaded
            35,000 young American shad into open milk cans, placed the
            fish-laden cans in a railcar, and headed west. Several days later,
            with frequent changes of water in the fish cans (every two hours
            when possible), Dr. Stone and the fish arrived safely in California.
            The American shad was introduced successfully into western waters
            and the seeds of demand for widespread stocking with hatchery-reared
            fish were planted in the minds of the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            <img
              src="/record/images/34fish-car.jpg"
              alt="Fish Car"
              width="300"
              height="225"
              align="right"
              style="padding-left: 10px"
            />By 1881, the U.S. Fish Commission decided to purchase a baggage
            car specially equipped for hauling fish, and the &ldquo;Era of the
            Fish Car&rdquo; began. Over the next 50 years, 10 railcars, each one
            more technologically advanced than previous models, would be added
            to the fleet of fish cars. Harlan and Hollingsworth built several of
            these fish cars, including Car #3, which has been restored to its
            original condition and now is on display at the D.C. Booth Historic
            National Fish Hatchery in Spearfish, SD.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the fact that the fish in transit needed nearly constant
            attention to be sure that the water maintained appropriate
            temperature, had essential levels of dissolved oxygen, and
            wasn&rsquo;t polluted with wastes, a crew of men was required. As a
            result, the fish car had to accommodate human, as well as fish
            needs. Fish cars typically carried a crew of five people: a captain,
            a cook, and three fish caretakers. The captain had a small cabin to
            himself, while the rest of the crew had bunks suspended over the
            fish tanks and small closets for personal belongings.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to tanks, or space for fish cans, the fish cars had
            large insulated boxes for ice. Ice was used to keep temperatures
            relatively low because fish handle better when cool, dissolved
            oxygen is more plentiful, and the potential for disease is lower.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first fish cars were made entirely of wood, except for the steel
            carriages upon which they rode, and were quiet impressive examples
            of woodworking arts. Later models were made of steel, except for the
            interior woodwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            Careful records of the number of fish transported and the number of
            miles traveled were maintained. By the early 1920s, when the use of
            fish cars started to decrease, over 72 billion fish had been
            distributed and the fish cars had traveled more than a million
            miles. Because railroad tracks did not go to many of the lakes and
            streams that were stocked, &ldquo;messengers&rdquo; met the fish
            cars at designated sidings and hauled the fish to stocking sites,
            first by horse and wagon, then in trucks. The local messengers
            traveled an additional 8 million miles.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the 1930s many more hatcheries had been built so the need for
            long distance hauling of fish was reduced greatly. Heavier trucks
            with enclosed tanks gradually replaced the fish cars. By 1940 only
            three fish cars were still operating. The last fish car, Car #10,
            the pride of the fleet, was retired in 1947. At least three of the
            fish cars have been saved from the salvage yards, but most have
            simply disappeared, probably dismantled and sold as scrap. In
            addition to the Federal fleet, several states bought fish cars.
            Wisconsin has initiated plans to restore these pieces of history,
            but for now, the best place to observe one is at the D.C. Booth
            Historic National Fish Hatchery in Spearfish, S.D. The restored
            historic hatchery also provides visitors with a good understanding
            of life at a fish hatchery in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
          </p>
          <h3>A Personal Connection to the Company</h3>
          <p>
            Learning that I have a family connection to the railcar company that
            built the fish cars (see page 1) inspired me to &ldquo;dig
            into&rdquo; the history of Harlan and Hollingsworth. Actually, I
            have a double connection to this corporation. My great-greatgreat-
            grandmother was Sarah Hollingsworth, wife of Aaron Harlan (#41). I
            am not a direct descendant of Samuel Harlan or Elijah Hollingsworth,
            principal partners in the firm. My family connection to these two
            men must be traced back to the original immigrant families, George
            Harlan &amp; Elizabeth (Duck) Harlan, and Valentine Hollingsworth
            &amp; Ann (Calvert) Hollingsworth. Though distant, it&rsquo;s still
            a connection. We&rsquo;re all part of the great heritage of these
            two families who shared so much in the early history of our nation.
            The number and variety of connections in these two families is truly
            impressive. It&rsquo;s almost a surprise when a family member
            married outside of these families.
          </p>
          <p>
            The firm of Harlan and Hollingsworth traces its origins back to
            1836, when Mahlon Betts and Samuel Pusey formed a partnership to
            build railroad cars in Wilmington, DE. Samuel Harlan, a skilled
            cabinetmaker, joined the partnership in 1837, and the firm became
            Betts, Pusey, and Harlan. A stock market panic in 1837, followed by
            an economic depression, undoubtedly provided a struggle for the new
            firm, but nevertheless they prospered. Their eight-wheeled wooden
            cars gained a following, and by late 1839 they had delivered 39
            passenger cars and 28 mail/baggage/freight cars. Around 1840 the
            firm expanded into the repair of wooden ships. In 1841, Elijah
            Hollingsworth, Samuel Harlan&rsquo;s brother-in-law, bought out
            Pusey&rsquo;s share of the company and the name was changed to
            Betts, Harlan, and Hollingsworth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company started to diversify in the early 1840s. For several
            years they produced &ldquo;hand tub&rdquo; engines for fire
            fighting. In 1841, they became the first of Wilmington shipbuilders
            to manufacture iron ships, a new concept. In 1844, Betts, Harlan,
            and Hollingsworth launched the Bangor, the first propeller-driven
            iron-hull steamship in the United States, then quickly moved on to
            the production of twin-screw steamships for ocean travel. By 1850,
            Betts had left the company and it became known as Harlan &amp;
            Hollingsworth, engine builders and machinists. J. Taylor Gause
            became a partner in 1858, and the name was changed to Harlan,
            Hollingsworth &amp; Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the firm continued to build railroad cars, shipbuilding was
            dominant. Charles Morgan, owner of the Southern Steamship Company,
            was a particularly good customer. By 1860 he had purchased four
            steamships; over time, he bought 28. The compartmentalized hulls of
            these ships were apparently an especially desired feature. During
            the Civil War, Harlan, Hollingsworth, &amp; Co. was considered the
            preeminent shipbuilder in Wilmington, and this city was the national
            leader for shipbuilding.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find it interesting that it took several years before anyone
            thought of steel railway cars and roughly 50 years before steel
            railway cars became accepted. Acceptance was slow, but Harlan,
            Hollingsworth, &amp; Co. continued to pursue this innovation. A
            number of steel freight cars were built, but steel passenger cars
            did not appear in substantial numbers until the late-19th century.
            Elijah Hollingsworth did not live to see the acceptance of steel
            railroad cars. He was killed in a shipyard accident in 1866.
            Apparently, the loss of his partner and brother-inlaw was very
            depressing to Samuel Harlan. He lost interest in the business soon
            after Hollingsworth&rsquo;s death. In 1867, the partnership was
            dissolved and the company was incorporated in Delaware as The Harlan
            &amp; Hollingsworth Company.
          </p>
          <p>
            The company prospered for many more years, continuing to build ships
            and railroad cars until 1926. The shipyard reopened in 1942 and
            built approximately 440 landing craft during World War II. The
            railcar aspect prospered through the 1920s, being second only to the
            Pullman Company* in the number of cars produced. Railcar production
            ceased around 1940; parts were produced until 1944.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ownership of the company becomes murky after 1900. Some records
            indicate that it remained independent into the 1940s, while others
            claim it became part of Bethlehem Steel, and eventually U.S. Steel,
            in 1904 &ndash;1906. Whatever the actual case, it seems clear that
            our family connection essentially ended with Samuel Harlan&rsquo;s
            departure from the business.
          </p>

            There is no doubt that the firm of Harlan &amp; Hollingsworth played
            a major role in the development of the U.S. transportation industry.
            The &ldquo;Fish Car Era&rdquo; is one small part of the history of
            the company and of the United States. However, it is a bit of
            history with a very personal connection for me.

            Anniversary
          </h2>
          <p>
            Blue Ridge Baptist Church will host its annual May Sing on Sunday,
            May 3, 2009. This year the church members and Blue Ridge Harlan
            descendants will also celebrate the 150th Anniversary of the church.
            While the May Sing began in 1887, the church was established in 1859
            and sits, modestly, in a clearing of trees on land donated to the
            Blue Ridge Community by George Harlan. The sermon, singing, and
            sharing of church history will certainly afford those who attend a
            wonderful opportunity to worship and walk in the footsteps of their
            ancestors. All are invited.

            begins with Senator Harlan&rsquo;s arrival in Mount Pleasant in 1853
            and continues through the death of the last Lincoln descendant in
            1985.
          </p>

            />While clearing out her mother&rsquo;s possessions after her death,
            Laura Turner found an article from the Shreveport Times about the
            death of her step-father, Monas Harlan, and submitted it to The
            Harlan Family. The exact date of the publication is not known, but
            the year is believed to be 1986. Laura&rsquo;s mother, Vivianne, was
            married to Monas for almost 20 years, but they were divorced at the
            time of his death. The article reads:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Monas Harlan, noted performer at area concerts and music
              instructor at Centenary College for nearly two decades, died
              Sunday in his native Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p>
              Harlan joined the college in 1959 and soon became a familiar
              face&mdash;and voice&mdash;at area and regional operas, concerts
              and oratorios. When he retired in 1977 as professor emeritus of
              music there, he was feted with a free public musical going-away
              party.
            </p>
            <p>
              Small wonder. In his 74 years, Harlan sung under such conductors
              as Pierre Monteux and Alfred Wallenstein and performed with such
              groups as the St. Louis Opera Company, the Los Angeles
              Philharmonic and the San Francisco Symphony. He also made several
              European tours with the All American Chorus under the direction of
              James Allen Dash. He also performed with the Shreveport
              Symphony&rsquo;s string section as a cellist and was director of
              music for Lakeview Methodist Church.
            </p>
            <p>
              Harlan began his career with formal studies at Juilliard School of
              Music in New York City, the University of Southern California and
              at Westminster College in Pennsylvania.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before his employment at Centenary, he was a soloist at the First
              Presbyterian Church in Hollywood, Calif., as well as instructor at
              universities in Kentucky and Montana.
            </p>

          <p>
            Shortly after the completion of the autumn harvest of 1861, a 19-
            year-old Columbiana County, Ohio, man named George Washington Harlan
            enlisted in the Union army. Six feet tall and of lean, muscular
            build, he was the oldest of five children and his father&rsquo;s
            right-hand man on the family&rsquo;s one-hundredacre farm in Knox
            Township.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan and his neighbors from the area formed an outfit that would
            eventually be designated as Company B, 65th Ohio Volunteer Infantry.
            The 65th&rsquo;s first colonel was a 25-year-old West Pointer named
            Charles G. Harker. George Harlan was appointed third corporal.
          </p>

            />In 1862, Harlan and his comrades became seasoned soldiers, being
            present at Shiloh, Corinth and Perryville. On December 31, 1862,
            during the battle of Stones River, the 65th Ohio engaged in severe
            and extended combat. Harker&rsquo;s brigade suffered heavy
            casualties defending the critical Nashville Turnpike. Of the 43 men
            of Company B who were engaged that day, 34 were killed or wounded.
            Remarkably, George Harlan was one of the nine men who remained
            unscathed. He was promoted on the field to sergeant.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brigade&rsquo;s history, written by Wilbur Hinman, states that
            the 65th Ohio received new national colors in late April 1863.
            Harlan was entrusted with these as color sergeant on May 2, just
            prior to the Tullahoma and Chattanooga campaigns.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the second day of the battle of Chickamauga, on September 20,
            1863, Harker&rsquo;s brigade was part of General Thomas Wood&rsquo;s
            division, which received the fateful order to support another part
            of the battle line, leaving a critical gap in the Union center.
            Rebels hit that gap, shattering the second of Wood&rsquo;s two
            brigades. Harker&rsquo;s regiments immediately turned back and
            delivered a counterattack, driving back the Rebels, then halting in
            a single line extending from a copse of trees on their left to a
            prominent knoll on their right. As the rightmost regiment of the
            line, the 65th occupied this relatively open knoll.
          </p>
          <p>
            In front of them was a scene of violence and confusion, dust and
            smoke, disorganized units and fleeing men. Harker and Wood, not
            knowing the extent of the disaster, were expecting to see Union
            troops appear from that direction; thus they were at first not
            alarmed by the sight of a strong line of battle moving parallel to
            theirs and seemingly dressed in blue. The unknown soldiers were
            South Carolinians who recently had received new uniforms consisting
            of dark bluish jackets and light blue trousers.
          </p>
          <p>
            To avoid firing on their own troops, Harker and Wood ordered their
            men to cease firing and lie down while their regimental color
            bearers were told to &ldquo;keep the flags well up&rdquo; and wave
            them from side to side to positively identify Harker&rsquo;s men.
            The most prominent of the national colors along the line were those
            flaunted from the height of the open knoll by Sgt. George Harlan.
          </p>
          <p>
            That Harlan did his dangerous duty well is evidenced by at least
            three Confederate reports. General Joseph Kershaw, commanding the
            South Carolina brigade, reported that the Federal &ldquo;colors were
            ostentatiously displayed along the lines.&rdquo; General Bushrod
            Johnson saw &ldquo;upon the eminence &hellip; the United States flag
            now floating &hellip;&rdquo; Years later, Private John Coxe of the
            2nd South Carolina recollected in the Confederate Veteran that the
            Yanks were &ldquo;on the top of the knob and waved their flag as if
            to say, &lsquo;Come on.&rsquo;&rdquo; Initially, there was
            indiscriminate firing from the Confederates. Then, they opened with
            a heavier fire, directed at the exposed color bearers, who began to
            topple. Harlan &ldquo;bravely faced the storm of bullets that
            greeted him on every side,&rdquo; according to senior captain Thomas
            Powell&rsquo;s after-action report.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the identity of the advancing Confederates was clearly
            established, Harker&rsquo;s brigade returned fire, and the two
            brigades locked in desperate combat for approximately 30 minutes.
            Both sides suffered heavy casualties before the Federal line was
            outflanked and forced back. But the sacrifice of Harker&rsquo;s
            brigade was not in vain. They had bought with their blood the
            critical time necessary for General George Thomas to organize the
            defense of a strong position on Snodgrass Hill and Horseshoe Ridge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the blood was George Harlan&rsquo;s, who was, according to
            the brigade&rsquo;s historian, &ldquo;severely wounded in the arm
            but clung to the flag, which was soon stained with his blood.&rdquo;
            Captain Powell wrote that Harlan, &ldquo;even after being severely
            wounded, stood at his post till ordered to the rear.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan&rsquo;s left forearm was broken by a rifle ball, which
            coursed down into the elbow joint. Company muster records show him
            in a field hospital at Stephenson, Alabama, and later in Nashville.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recovery was slow. Harlan returned to his company the next September
            while still partially disabled. He was left with a crooked, stiff
            arm.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was discharged at the end of his term, a few months later, on
            December 14, 1864, and received a permanent disability pension of
            four dollars per month. Ironically, the government did not have to
            pay this for very long. On September 21, 1865, while helping in the
            fields back home during harvest, he was killed in a threshing
            machine accident. He was 23.
          </p>
          <p>
            The news of Harlan&rsquo;s calamitous death must have touched the
            hearts of his comrades with an especial poignancy. The Grand Army of
            the Republic post in Alliance, Ohio, was named for &ldquo;brave,
            stalwart Sergeant George W. Harlan &hellip; who bore the colors of
            the 65th.&rdquo; The post charter stated that &ldquo;he was an
            exemplary young man in every respect.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            It was this post&rsquo;s duty to conduct Memorial Day observances
            and participate in parades, reviews, and receptions. In the course
            of these events, or at special ceremonies held at Quaker Hill
            Cemetery, where Harlan was buried, succeeding generations heard the
            story of a brave color bearer. That was how they believed it should
            be, for a man does not really die until he is forgotten.

          <p>
            The late <b>Enoch &ldquo;Skip&rdquo; Lewis Harlan, Jr., </b>of
            Taneytown, Md., owned an original print of the book because his
            grandfather, Enoch Harlan (#9535) was in charge of the committee
            that raised money for Alpheus&rsquo; research and travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skip and his wife, Nancy, were married 57 years. She says that every
            time a visitor came, Skip would bring out the book and search for a
            connection. He was very proud of his heritage and the fact that he
            was the sixth Enoch Harlan in a row. The couple attended both of the
            Delaware national reunions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a teenager in the 1940s, <b>John R. Harlan,</b> Augusta, Ga., and
            treasurer of The Harlan Family in America, asked his father about
            the family history and was told not much was known except two
            brothers, George and Michael, came to America in the late 1600s.
          </p>
          <p>
            His father said a book about the family history had been published,
            so John set out to obtain a copy when possible. While he was
            stationed in Ankara, Turkey, in 1968, John obtained the address of a
            used book merchant in Baltimore, Md., and inquired about the
            availability of a book on the Harlan family history. The merchant
            had a copy and shipped it to John for $25. The front cover was
            missing, so he took it to a book binder in Ankara and had it bound.
          </p>
          <p>
            This copy of Alpheus Harlan&rsquo;s book was used for reprinting the
            green book the Family association has been selling since 1987. To
            date, more than 2,500 copies have been printed, and the profits have
            been used to support Harlan Family activities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Frances Pickin Florio,</b> greatgranddaughter of Alpheus Harlan,
            has a very personal story to tell:
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;As far as I am aware, the last six unbound copies of the
            Harlan Genealogy from (I am guessing) the second printing done in
            the 1930s are in my father&rsquo;s basement in Madison, New Jersey.
            The Genealogy was initially distributed by Alpheus&rsquo; son and
            daughter, my Great Uncle William Harlan and Great Aunt Maude Harlan,
            from the 1920s to the 1950s. After William died in 1955 and Maude in
            1959, the responsibility for the Genealogy passed to their brother
            Thomas&rsquo;s daughter, Ruth Harlan Leist, and their sister
            Flora&rsquo;s son, John Harlan Pickin (my father).
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;After Aunt Maude passed away in 1959, my father and his
            cousin Ruth went through what had survived the flood waters that had
            filled the first floor of the house in New Burlington, Ohio. My
            father came home to New Jersey with unbound pages of the Genealogy
            as well as books from his grandfather&rsquo;s library, a
            daguerreotype of Alpheus&rsquo;s brother Thomas (in whose memory the
            Genealogy is dedicated), some of the letters that Alpheus must have
            used to write the Genealogy, and other Harlan memorabilia &ndash;
            including ribbons and programs from some of the early Harlan
            reunions in the 1910s.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;The Genealogy was shipped from the printer as unbound pages;
            Ruth had them bound depending upon demand. I remember in the 1960s
            that we in New Jersey had most of the remaining unbound pages, and
            Dad would mail off a package with ten &ldquo;books&rdquo; to Ruth in
            Miamisburg, Ohio, at odd intervals. She took care of sales and,
            guessing from what I have read in this publication, sold the copies
            to the people who got this organization going.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Dad was interviewed in 1969 by a newspaper reporter, John
            Baskin, who was writing a book about New Burlington. After my father
            passed away in 2005, I found that some of the chapters of that book
            are posted on the Web: &lt;http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF
            001973/Baskin/Baskin.html&gt;
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the photographs with this article is one from around 1900,
            showing Alpheus in front of the house in New Burlington, with his
            wife, his two daughters and son, and their cousin John Haydock and
            his wife and their son.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;When Ruth died in 1986, my father went through the bound
            copies and unbound pages that remained and threw out the ones that
            had been damaged by exposure to the Ohio floods as well as by one
            rainy period in New Jersey when my father, realizing that our
            basement was collecting water, ran down and frantically grabbed the
            boxes with the Genealogy and brought them upstairs. For several
            weeks afterwards, the damp pages were draped over a clothes line and
            I was told to not touch them until they were thoroughly dried out!
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;My father passed away in October 2005. During his retirement
            he was active in a men&rsquo;s club that was chronically lacking
            speakers so Dad would happily volunteer to do a talk on New
            Burlington every couple of years or so. I never met my grandmother
            or my grandfather, but I feel I know them from the stories that Dad
            told. And through all of them was how we are all related. On my 21st
            birthday, he gave me my own copy of the Genealogy. It was a
            wonderful present.
          </p>
          <p>
            &ldquo;As far as I can recall from what my father told me, the first
            printing of the Genealogy was of something like 100 copies and was
            paid for by subscription. I believe they cost $10. There was a funny
            story about one relative asking why he should pay out so much money
            (remember &ndash; this was 1913!) and he wanted to know what famous
            people he was related to. Alpheus said that as far as he was aware,
            there were only five horse thieves in the family! Good put down! I
            wonder if the relative bought a copy?&rdquo;

            <a name="atom"></a>Lee O. Harlan First to Fly Historic Atom Plane
          </h2>
          <p>
            <i>
              The story of Lee O. Harlan, pilot, is excerpted from The Canyon
              (Texas) News, February 21, 1963. He descended from George #3,
              James #11, John #44, Isaac #207, Isaac #797, Washington #2717,
              Josiah #6807, William J.
            </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a bright June afternoon when test pilot Lee Harlan walked out
            across the Offutt Field runway at Omaha toward the big aerial
            monster he was about to put through its paces. Harlan noticed two
            things about this particular B- 29 that were different from the
            other B-29s he had test flown.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four propellers, powered by giant Wright engines, had reverse
            pitch. This would permit a pilot to land the plane safely with an
            unexploded bomb, even if the brakes were burned out. He noticed,
            too, that there was something remarkably different about the bomb
            bay.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan jotted down the aircraft&rsquo;s number&mdash;86292&mdash;a
            number that would live forever in history. He climbed into the big
            plane, made his way to the cockpit, turned several switches and
            studied a maze of dials intently. A man with a fire extinguisher
            stood by as he revved up the engines and taxied to the apron. He
            heard, &ldquo;You may take off now! You are cleared to take
            off,&rdquo; from the tower.
          </p>
          <p>
            The big Wrights roared to crescendo. The colossal plane trembled
            from nose to tail fin. She eased forward at first, then faster and
            faster. Harlan pulled the wheel gently toward him. Offutt&rsquo;s
            runway fell away and Lee Harlan became the first man to fly the
            Enola Gay.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was June 11, 1945. Two months later Harlan learned that the
            plane he had tested had dropped a bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, and
            opened the nuclear age. This bomb and the one dropped three days
            later on Nagasaki by Enola Gay&rsquo;s sister B-29, had ended World
            War II many months earlier than Allied leaders had anticipated and
            without the loss of many thousands of American lives which an
            invasion of Japan would have cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Harlan&rsquo;s black-bound pilot&rsquo;s log book, itself a legal
            document, the test flight of 86292, the Enola Gay, is duly recorded.
            In the page margin is a penned notation&mdash;atom bomb, Hiroshima,
            Japan, 8-6-45.
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan began flying in 1927 &mdash; the year Lindbergh crossed the
            Atlantic Ocean solo in the Spirit of St. Louis. He did much of his
            flying around Amarillo, Texas, and in Missouri and Oklahoma.
            &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have airfields in those days,&rdquo; he
            remembers. &ldquo;We landed in cow pastures.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            Harlan got his pilot&rsquo;s license in 1940. For a time he was a
            civilian flight instructor for the Army giving pre-glider
            instruction. Flight experience which won him his license all was
            prior to his army service. He went to work for the Glenn L. Martin
            Company in April of 1943 as a test pilot. The first plane he tested
            was the old B-26, sometimes known as the &ldquo;Widow Maker&rdquo;
            or the &ldquo;Flying Coffin.&rdquo; The B-26 was a hot ship with a
            high landing take-off speed, as compared to aircraft of its day.
            Harlan took the bombers off the assembly line for their initial
            flights to iron the &ldquo;bugs&rdquo; out before they were turned
            over to the armed forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            How did he feel about the atom bombing of Hiroshima? &ldquo;I just
            wish it could have fallen on the heads of war mongers who started
            the war instead of on innocent people at Hiroshima,&rdquo; he
            commented.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i
              >Editor&rsquo;s Note: Lee Harlan closed out his test pilot log
              book October 1, 1945, but never quit flying. He went on to become
              an Allis Chalmers tractor dealer, car dealer, crop duster and
              ambulance plane pilot, retiring in Clarinda, Iowa.

          <h2><a name="gcorner"></a>GENEALOGY CORNER: A Chance Meeting</h2>
          <p>
            You never know where you are going to meet another Harlan relative.
            While attending a conference in Scottsdale, Ariz., in September
            2008, conversation around the table was about genealogy. Since the
            conference was a colonial lineage group, genealogy tended to be a
            topic that was very popular. I mentioned having attended a reunion
            in Reno in 2007, and the lady to my immediate left very animatedly
            said, &ldquo;Are you a part of the Harlan family?&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>
            As my new &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; and I began to chat, it was
            interesting to find out what she knew about the Harlans. She had not
            attended any of the reunions but had wanted to do so. I encouraged
            her to go to the Harlan Web site to learn all about our reunions and
            then plan to attend the next one in 2012. As a widow who might be
            uncomfortable traveling alone, I encouraged her to get her children
            to take her to the next reunion, which in turn might get more people
            involved and who will hopefully catch the bug.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attending the national reunions is just one way to gain more
            interest in the Harlan lineage and current descendants. And who is
            more interested in that knowledge than another Harlan? Those who
            attend the reunions have different interests. Some go to meet with
            extended family members; some go to meet and socialize with people
            from various walks of life; some go looking for answers to questions
            about their ancestors. Then there are those who go to meet old
            friends they have acquired since these reunions began in 1987.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in the end it all boils down to the fact that you never know
            when or where you&rsquo;ll meet another Harlan! My new
            &ldquo;cousin&rdquo; is Dorothy Baumgartner of Missouri. I&rsquo;m
            from Indiana.
