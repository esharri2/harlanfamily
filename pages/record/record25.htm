          The Man Who Would Be King by Ray King</b

      <p align="left">
        Now I ask you&#151;am I to add to my list of prominent Harlans (Supreme
        Court justices, senator, president&#146;s daughter-in-law) another one:
        Josiah Harlan? <br />
        <br />
        I had never heard of him until Dan Harlan&#146;s drama about Harlans at
        the 2002 national reunion and a piece about him in The Harlan Record
        that year. But &#147;prominent&#148;? Army doctor, spy, Punjab governor
        and Afghan army commander ... and Afghan king! ? Now that&#146;s
        something else. That&#146;s prominent.<br />
      </p>
      <p align="left">
        I&#146;m staring at page 335 of &#147;The Book&#148;&#151;Alpheus
        Harlan&#146;s History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family&#151; where he
        lists Josiah Harlan (#1200). Meager information. Yet the paragraph
        slowly swells to the size of a 300-page book, The Man Who Would Be
        King&#151;The First American in Afghanistan, by Ben Macintyre (Farrar,
        Straus and Giroux, 2004).<br />
        <br />
        Macintyre, a London Times correspondent, has been in Afghanistan several
        times. He found references to Josiah Harlan there that reminded him of
        &#147;Daniel Dravot&#148; in Rudyard Kipling&#146;s The Man Who Would Be
        King. He researched Josiah&#146;s story there and in America. And in a
        small museum in Chester County, Pa., he found a tattered yellow
        manuscript written by Josiah, plus letters, poems, drawings and&#151;
        incredibly&#151;a 170-year-old document naming the American as the king
        of Ghor in Afghanistan. It had been thought that Josiah&#146;s papers,
        including his autobiography, had been lost in a house fire in 1929. With
        the discovery of Josiah&#146;s writings, Macintyre was able to use
        actual quotations from Josiah while writing his book. <br />
        <br />
        Macintyre tells a fascinating story of reckless adventurer, with
        political intrigue, extreme personal danger, plots and sub-plots,
        accomplishment and frustration. Of the many risks Josiah took, the
        author says, &#147;Harlan enjoyed only the protection of his abilities.
        They were more than sufficient.&#148;<br />
        <br />
        Josiah came to love Afghanistan in his twelve years in that region. As a
        botanist he reveled in their gardens and productivity. He learned their
        language and culture and had close friends there.<br />
        <br />
        He was in the service of Shah Shujah, deposed Kabul ruler who, in exile,
        lived in Ludhiana, in farthest west India. Josiah first went to Kabul to
        spy out the feasibility of the Shah&#146;s return to power there. He
        concluded it wouldn&#146;t happen without British armed support.<br />
        <br />
        He next was governor of Gujrat under the Maharaja Ranjit Singh, King of
        Lahore&shy;Punjab. He spent most of the time as a close companion and
        army commander for Dost Mohammed Khan, ruler of Kabul, who had
        threatened to kill Josiah while the latter was an envoy of Ranjit Singh
        in peace talks.<br />
        <br />
        Kipling&#146;s &#147;king&#148; was evidently inspired by Josiah&#146;s
        military campaign northwest of Kabul to put down a warlord who was
        raiding villages and selling all inhabitants into slavery. It was on
        that venture that Josiah received the written document declaring him a
        king. It wasn&#146;t won by conquest but conferred in an agreement with
        the Mohammed Reffee, of the Hazara people. It was to secure
        Josiah&#146;s help in civil and military development in the Hazara
        region. We&#146;ll never know how it would have worked out because
        Josiah was never back there again.<br />
        <br />
        In recruiting an army years before, and on this military campaign,
        Josiah flew the Stars and Stripes with no authority from America to use
        this ensign for military exploits there. It seems a bizarre kind of
        colonizing&#151; maybe even misrepresentation.<br />
        <br />
        From boyhood, Josiah was an admirer of Alexander the Great. He thought
        often of Alexander while there. He stood in places where Alexander stood
        and followed the same route the Greek chose when coming from the north
        into Afghanistan. He imagined himself a successor of Alexander&#151;with
        the same objective to bring <br />
        righteous progress to an oppressed people by taking up arms against the
        systems then in place.<br />
        <br />
        Josiah was in Afghanistan when the British army won a devastating
        victory over the Afghans in 1839. Later, when back in America, he
        published a scathing criticism of the British brutal misrule of Afghans.
        He said they sowed the seeds of their own death by wholesale massacre in
        1842, after only two years and five months of British rule. Needless to
        say, his book was so inflammatory that he could find no publisher for
        his other writings.<br />
        <br />
        Josiah returned to America in 1841. He had been removed from membership
        in the Quaker Meeting in Chester County, Pa., because of his military
        service. He was reinstated and married Elizabeth Baker in 1849 in a
        Quaker ceremony. With the onset of the Civil War in 1861, he recruited a
        cavalry unit for the Union <br />
        Army. After a difficult training period involving conflict with junior
        officers, Colonel Harlan became too ill to continue and left the army in
        1862. <br />
        <br />
        He died in 1871 in San Francisco, where a city directory listed him as
        &#147;Harlan, J., physician, dwelling at 1091 Market Street.&#148;
        (Actually, Josiah wasn&#146;t trained as a doctor but had some of his
        brother&#146;s medical books, making him more of a medic than a
        doctor.)<br />
        <br />
        If we could, we might add the details Ben Macintyre provides to Alpheus
        Harlan&#146;s account on page 335 and conclude, &#147;And that&#146;s
        the rest of the story.&#148;

        <i>Editor&#146;s Note</i>: Ben Macintyre&#146;s book has received a fair
        amount of media attention since it was published in May, particularly
        because of current events in Afghanistan and Iraq. Harlan cousins have
        sent in notices and reviews from several publications, including &lt;
        nytimes.com &gt; (Macintyre compares 19th-century British military
        activities in Afghanistan to America&#146;s activities today in this
        commentary posted May 8), the <i>New York Review of Books</i> (May 13),
        <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (date unknown), <i>The Spectator </i>(June 26),
        <i>The New Yorker </i>(May 17), and BBC News Online (May 26). <br />
        <br />
        The BBC news article states that two great, great, great-grandsons of
        Josiah Harlan have been located&#151;Scott Reiniger, a Hollywood actor
        who starred in the 1978 horror film <i>Dawn of the Living Dead</i>, and
        his younger brother, Harlan. The brothers are descendants of Josiah and
        Elizabeth&#146;s daughter, Sarah Victoria. Ben Macintyre attempted to
        track Josiah&#146;s heirs but ran into difficulty since his only child
        was a daughter. <br />
        <br />
        Scott remembers his father talking about Josiah and showing him the
        adventurer&#146;s sword, which is now owned by brother Harlan.<br />
        <br />
        As a result of a signed treaty, the title &#147;Prince of Ghor&#148; is
        to be granted, in perpetuity, to Josiah&#146;s heirs. Scott learned that
        he is prince of the Afghan province of Ghor when brother Harlan read
        reviews of Macintyre&#146;s book and notified Scott. Scott&#146;s
        initial reaction was that the news was &#147;incredibly surreal.&#148;
        He said he has no intention of claiming the title and added that his
        brother should have it since he has the Harlan name and is the family
        historian. <br />
        <br />
        Macintyre is quoted as saying, &#147;The treaty remains in effect,
        although it would be a brave man who attempted to reassert his claim to
        be the Prince of Ghor.&#148;

      <b><a name="Wayne"></a>Wayne Harlan Gives Blood&#151;Lots of It</b><br />
      <i
        >Some information taken from a June 21, 2004, article by Hali Cartee of
        the Palladium-Item newspaper staff, Richmond, Ind.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      <i
        >Wayne Harlan of Liberty, Ind., has donated blood since 1940 when he was
        16 years old. Now 79, he has donated almost 43 gallons.</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      He got started when his high school coach asked him and a school mate to
      give blood for the coach&#146;s aunt who happened to be Wayne&#146;s
      neighbor. Blood was then collected in glass bottles. Since then he has
      donated when called upon, including for the American Red Cross during
      World War II.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne has been active in Freemasonry for over 58 years, once serving as
      Master of his lodge and as secretary for the last 34 years. In the 1980s,
      his Masonic Lodge in Liberty established a blood bank for both lodge
      members and anyone else in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembers one night when he received a phone call about a man with
      cancer who needed blood. Lodge members provided 21 pints of blood to the
      man, and the thought still brings tears to his eyes. Wayne recalls how
      grateful the man&#146;s mother was and said, &#147;Things like that are
      just a part of living. You give to each other.&#148; His philosophy is
      simple: give blood if you can.<br />
      <br />
      Wayne continues to give to his neighbors and community in a number of
      ways. He mows the old school yard in Kitchel, Ind., and every Wednesday he
      drives a Dodge van to take veterans to the Dayton Veterans Affairs Medical
      Center.
    </p>
    <p>
      While at the VA, he helps at the information desk, directing patients or
      providing wheelchairs and escorting patients to appointments. He
      volunteers his time through the Wayne County Veterans Council.But
      it&#146;s the listening that is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#147;Each person has his own story to tell. The best thing is to
      listen,&#148; he said. &#147;I&#146;d go every day if they&#146;d let
      me.&#148;
    </p>
    <p>
      Wayne has helped provide Masonic funeral services for members since 1952.
      In April 2004, he conducted a Masonic service for his brother, Lowell B.
      Harlan, at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. &#147;It was not
      easy,&#148; he said.

      <a name="Reno"></a><b>Reno To Be Site of 2007 Reunion</b><br />
      <br />
      The Harlan Family in America board of directors held its annual meeting in
      Reno, Nev., April 17, 2004, and picked that city as the site for its next
      national reunion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reno is less than an hour&#146;s drive from the infamous Donner Pass,
      which proved deadly to some western migrants in the winter of 1846-47, but
      was the gateway to a new life in California for the luckier Harlan party.
      Not only does the area provide an important site for learning about Harlan
      history, it also abounds in natural beauty, western amusements and
      history, and adult and family entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reunion will be held July 12-15, 2007, at the John Ascuaga&#146;s
      Nugget Hotel. Tentative plans are for registration, tours, and an opening
      reception on Thursday; offsite group activities on Friday; workshops
      (including one on the Harlans&#146; western trek), a banquet on Saturday;
      and a church service and closing <br />
      brunch on Sunday. Several direct descendants of George Harlan #852, who
      led his group&#146;s wagon train, will help to plan the program.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel will provide complimentary meeting and function space on the
      second floor, where children can also enjoy the pool and a video arcade.
      On the hotel&#146;s first floor are casino spaces and nine restaurants.
      Movie theaters are across the street, and parks, bowling alleys, and Lake
      Tahoe are nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hotel has guaranteed that the base rate for its rooms will be no more
      than $95 a night, single or double. Guests can use the hotel&#146;s
      fitness center, spas and pool free of charge. The area offers a whole
      range of accommodations, including motels and camping.
    </p>
    <p>
      William K. (Bill) Harlan, of California, a descendant of wagon train
      leader George Harlan, was elected to fill an opening on the board. He has
      also agreed to present information about his great-grandfather for the
      2007 reunion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coordinators for the various areas of responsibility have been selected to
      begin planning the reunion. Participation from other Harlan cousins is
      welcome&#151; please let us know how you would like to help!
    </p>
    <p>
      The board also voted to donate $750 to the All Hallows Church at
      Sutton-on-the-Forest in York, England, which has 15 monuments to two dozen
      Harlans. The church still uses a silver chalice presented to the church by
      Richard Harland, who lived from 1592-1689, and who is buried there. In May
      2003, the Harlan family group that toured Northeast England visited this
      church as well as other Harlan-related sites (see page one story in The
      Harlan Record, Fall 2003).
    </p>
    <p>
      The board&#146;s next meeting will be held in Sacramento, Calif., on April
      23, 2005. <br />

    <p><a name="scrapbook"></a><b>Scrapbook Is Full of Harlan History</b></p>
    <p>
      A California resident, Marjorie Ingram, recently received her
      great-great-great-grandfather&#146;s scrapbook which contains many
      original letters, family records, and newspaper articles. They give an
      invaluable look at Missouri, Indiana and the Dakotas in the 1800s, as well
      as revealing the political climate of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judge Andrew Jackson Harlan (#1761) was born in Hamilton County, Ohio, in
      1815 and at the age of 21, he left for Indiana. In 1838, he married
      Delilah Hendrix, and they had a daughter and son. In 1861 the family
      settled on a claim in the Dakota Territory, but according to Marjorie,
      they were chased out of the area by Indians and lost everything. They
      later lived in Wakeeny, Kans., and Savannah, Mo., where they are buried.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Alpheus Harlan&#146;s genealogy book, Judge Harlan
      represented the Marion (Indiana) District for two years in the Lower House
      of Congress, and later served a term in Missouri&#146;s General Assembly.
      He was also a member of the Constitutional Convention of the Territory of
      Dakota, a judge, and spent four years as a postmaster in Wakeeny.
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving the scrapbook items, Marjorie searched the Internet and
      located the Harlan Web site. She was surprised that a newer version of The
      Harlan Record was being published. She descends from Adelia (#4902)
      daughter of Judge Harlan.<br />

      ><b>Record Keeping by Quakers Proves to Be Invaluable</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Information from&#147;Shaking Your Family Tree&#148;, a column by Myra
      Vanderpool Gormley
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      As early as 1675, a system of record keeping for Quakers was devised by
      George Fox, founder of the Society of Friends. These records were
      meticulous and extensive, providing genealogists invaluable tools for
      researching their roots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friends &#147;meeting&#148; records often contain characteristics and a
      language of their own, so it takes some study to be able to use them.
      Special research procedures are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book, <i>Our Quaker Ancestors: Finding Them in Quaker Records</i>, by
      Ellen Thomas Berry and David Allen Berry, gives some background and
      history of the American Quakers, including patterns of migration, the
      contents of monthly meeting records and how to locate and search them.
      Tips on finding and using Monthly
      <br />
      Meeting Records are covered, and a chapter is devoted to the various
      Quaker repositories. It aids in searches for both birthright members of
      the Friends Society and for those who became members through
      &quot;convincement&#148; or marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      For those wanting to follow Quaker ancestors into the Midwest, it is
      necessary to become familiar with certain migration patterns. A large
      southward movement began in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, going through the
      Monocacy region of Maryland around 1725, and crossing the Potomac into
      Frederick County, Va., in 1732. Another migration went from Maryland into
      North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.

      ><br />
      <i
        >Editor&#146;s Note: The following is a compilation of information from
        two biographical sketches written by John B. Harlan, subject of the
        story titled &#147;John Bailey Harlan Was Shrewd Detective&#148; on page
        8 of the Spring 2004 Harlan Record. Juanita Creighton, of Richmond, Va.,
        submitted the detective piece and the two sketches complied here. John
        B. Harlan was the brother of her grandfather, Howard Hinton Harlan
        (7956iii).</i
      ><br />
      <br />
      One of our Harlan cousins, James Forbes Harlan (#7956i), had some unusual
      professions. His brother, L&amp;N Railroad detective John B. Harlan
      (#7956v), provided the following information. <br />
      <br />
      Born in Albemarle County, Va., on July 12, 1851, James moved with his
      family shortly after the Civil War to Mountain Grove, Bath County, Va.,
      where they resided in a cabin on property owned by Colonel A.C.L.
      Gatewood, of Confederate fame. The farm was situated at the fork of Little
      Back Creek and Big Back Creek.
      <br />
      <br />
      &#147;Mountain Grove was a little scattering village consisting of a Post
      Office, Blacksmith and Wheelwright shop, and a Manufacturing Mill
      belonging to old Colonel Gatewood,&#148; brother John recalled. It was
      located with Warm Spring Mountain to the east and the Allegheny Mountains
      to the west. &#147;The little valley stretched up Big Back Creek perhaps
      eight or ten miles and ranged from two hundred and fifty feet to half a
      mile in width. In that section at that time, the mountains abounded with
      game, bear, deer, wolves, wild cats, panthers, catamount, <br />
      wild turkey, pheasants, and in fact all manner of game, and our chief
      occupation while in that section was hunting, trapping, and fishing,&#148;
      John wrote.
      <br />
      <br />
      In 1873 or &#146;74, the family moved to Greenbrier County, crossing the
      Allegheny Mountains in ox carts. They lived for about a year on Captain
      William Reed&#146;s farm, about a mile and a half northwest of Frankfort.
      They then lived for three years on the Lewis Creigh farm, then moved to
      Monroe County, to a section known as Swopes Knobs in the mountains near
      Johnson&#146;s Crossroads, about 15 miles from Union. Later the family
      moved to Henry County, Ky.<br />
      <br />
      During the years that James lived in Greenbrier and Monroe counties, he
      worked most of the time as a &#147;professional hacker of brush&#148; on
      the mountains near Cranberry Glades in Pocahontas County, according to his
      brother.<br />
      <br />
      &#147;While so engaged he came in contact with a Professor of Music from
      Richmond, Va., L.J. Whitt, who was also a Professor of Penmanship,&#148;
      John continued, &#147;and the two became very much interested in each
      other, and Professor Whitt induced Mr. Harlan to travel with him and give
      music lessons and also take lessons in penmanship from him. They traveled
      together for two years or more, making quite a success in their
      profession. After Professor Whitt had returned to Richmond from West
      Virginia, Mr. Harlan took up his profession of teaching penmanship as well
      as giving music lessons on banjo and violin, more especially on the
      banjo.&#148; James became well known by traveling around to the crossroads
      school houses and teaching music and penmanship. <br />
      <br />
      James Harlan&#146;s first banjo was a large gourd strung with horse hair,
      made for him by his grandfather&#146;s servant, known as Uncle Lewis, who
      drove the family carriage.<br />
      <br />
      &#147;After young Harlan got so he could strike a few tunes, there was a
      young lady in the neighborhood, Miss Mollie Clark, who took an interest in
      him, and being a good performer on the banjo herself, she taught him all
      the fundamental principles that she knew concerning banjo picking,&#148;
      John wrote.<br />
      <br />
      He was considered a &#147;very great entertainer,&#148; according to his
      brother, who added, &#147;Young Harlan was always ready to play for the
      old fashion dances or help entertain the youngsters in the several
      communities in which he lived, but never charged anything for this
      service. It was always rendered cheerfully. However, he made a nominal
      charge for lessons in penmanship and music.&#148;<br />
      <br />
      The family moved to Henry County, Ky, near New Castle, in 1881. In
      Kentucky, James Harlan continued to teach music and penmanship for a
      number of years, teaching in Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, and Tennessee as
      well. <br />
      <br />
      Around 1915, he began to work for the railroad in Alabama, Tennessee, and
      Kentucky. In 1927, the year John Harlan wrote his sketch, his brother was
      located in Covington, Ky., and had been working for the Louisville and
      Nashville Railroad Company for three years. He was planning to travel back
      to Virginia to participate in the Old Fiddler&#146;s Contest at
      Ronceverte.<br />

    </p>
    <p>
      The Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation Committee of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, will
      present four different sessions of a one-woman show depicting Mary Todd
      Lincoln on October 28-29 at Iowa Wesleyan College.The four presentations,
      acted by Donna McCreary and funded by the Haselmayer Endowment for the
      Arts, will be as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#149; Thursday, October 28, 11 am. &#147;Love is Eternal, Mrs.
      Lincoln.&#148; With the Civil War nearly over, the First Lady defends
      herself and her husband&#146;s political views and discusses the
      devastation the war has brought to her family. A number of her relatives
      supported the Confederacy, and she was criticized by politicians and
      reporters as a result. She also describes her family life and the
      Lincolns&#146; interest in theater, poetry, and politics.<br />
      <br />
      &#149; Thursday, October 28, 2 p.m. &#147;A Portrait of the Robert Todd
      Lincolns.&#148; Ms. McCreary studied letters written between Robert Todd
      Lincoln, Mary Harlan Lincoln, and their children to the Helms family
      cousins for this presentation.
      <br />
      <br />
      &#149; Thursday, October 28, 7 p.m. &#147;Mary, the Widow of
      Lincoln.&#148; Public performance with ticket sales to support the
      Harlan-Lincoln House project ($10 adults, $5 children). This 90-minute
      one-act play tells the story of Mary Lincoln after Lincoln&#146;s
      assassination. Through memories sparked by letters, pictures, and sounds,
      Mary remembers her life and family. The audience is taken back on the
      memorable journey and allowed to see the complexity of one of
      America&#146;s most controversial women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#149; Friday, October 29, 10:30 a.m. &#147;Mourning: It&#146;s a Way of
      Life.&#148; Ms. McCreary explains the complicated and strict rules of
      mourning during the time of Mary Todd Lincoln.

      I found this poem a while ago and think it is very appropriate for those
      who are &#147;hooked&#148; on researching their family heritage. It
      certainly fits many Harlan descendants who have pursued their family
      lineage.

      Keep climbing those trees!<br />

      <p>ANCESTORS</p>
      <p>
        The dusty libraries we&#146;ve delved,<br />
        Over massive tomes we&#146;ve poured.<br />
        And lore about our ancestors<br />
        Have gleamed as our reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&#146;ve found their names &#146;mid emigrants<br />
        Who left Old England&#146;s shore<br />
        On &#147;Mayflower&#148;, &#147;Ann&#148; and &#147;Hercules&#148;<br />
        And other ships galore.
      </p>
      <p>
        The search for hidden ancestors<br />
        Is an alluring quest<br />
        Which never gives its devotees<br />
        A single moment&#146;s rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        To all whose minds are in a groove,<br />
        Or prone to slothful ease,<br />
        We recommend the exercise<br />
        Of climbing family trees.
