The Harlan Family gathered at the Downtown Hilton in Lexington, Kentucky on July 16 to 19, 2022. The opening reception was held on Thursday night. Ed Smith, of the performance group Kentucky Chautauqua, played the role of Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan. His brief speech represented the life and times of the Justice. C.J. King appeared in costume as Mary Harlan Lincoln. The two personalities worked the room, providing interesting interactions and many photo opportunities.

On Friday morning busses loaded and headed in several directions throughout Kentucky's beautiful horse country. One tour drove through the Keeneland Racetrack on the way to Buffalo Trace bourbon distillery. A second tour got a behind-the-scenes look at Keeneland Racetrack and the Old Friends Thoroughbred Retirement Farm. A third tour went to Keeneland Racetrack and Claiborne Farm horse farm.

Informative sessions were presented on Friday afternoon. Robert Worden of Paducah, Ky., spoke on the life of Silas Harlan, who settled in Kentucky in 1774. At a tour of the Mary Todd Lincoln home C.J. King again appeared as Mary Harlan Lincoln to answer questions.

On Friday night we gathered for the official business meeting where new officers were elected and three new board members were introduced.

Saturday started with more bus tours. A ride through the gorgeous countryside ended at The Three Boys Farm Distillery. Keeneland Racetrack and Magdalena Farm held a small group tour. Another tour visited Keeneland Racetrack, Claiborne Farm and the surrounding area.

Saturday afternoon sessions were enjoyed by all. Peter Canellos, author of "John Marshall Harlan - The Great Dissenter" spoke twice. Fred Harlan and Steve Harrison talked about genealogy research. Susan Lindsey presented a Zoom session from Portugal on her book "Liberty Brought Us Here." Robert Worden talked about the history of Kentucky Quilts.

The Saturday night banquet with entertainment by our own "cousin" magician Dan Harlan was enjoyed by all.

On Sunday morning many attended the Worship service. It was a perfect way to end the reunion and showing gratitude for time spent with all of our Harlan family members.
