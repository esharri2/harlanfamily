          <p><img src="../Ridge & Marjory.jpg" width="302" height="222" align="right" border="1">The 
            Harlan Family in America association lost one of its strongest supporters 
            and ablest mentors when Ridge Latimer Harlan passed away on January 
            2, 2006, in Vacaville, Calif., after a long illness. He was 89.</p>
          <p>Ridge was proud of his family heritage. As Chair-person of the 310th 
            national reunion in Mount<br>
            Pleasant, Iowa, his mission was to promote strong family ties, immediate 
            and extended, and the continuation of the Harlan Family association.</p>
          <p>Ridge served on the Board of Directors from 1997-2002 and became 
            a board member emeritus in 2002. He was instrumental in creating the 
            Harlan Family association&#146;s mission statement.</p>
          <p>Harlan Family Vice President Junior Harlan said the following about 
            his relationship with Ridge: &#147;I met Ridge on the first Harlan 
            family trip to England in 1994 &#150; this was after Celebration 300 
            which commemorated the 300th anniversary of the arrival of George 
            and Michael Harlan in America.</p>
          <p>&#147;During that trip it was decided to have another national family 
            reunion, and Ridge volunteered to be the chairman. The core group 
            consisted of Ridge and Marjory Harlan, Jim and Sue Harlan, Dr. John 
            and Carrie Harlan, and Junior and Dorothy Harlan, all of Arizona.</p>
          <p>&#147;This became our &#145;winter project&#146; with many meetings. 
            During this time, I came to know Ridge. In working with him on this 
            project, I could see how strongly he felt about his heritage and how 
            he wanted to keep the family tradition alive with national reunions. 
            He believed that family was most important, and he worked tirelessly 
            to promote family ties, values and traditions. He was a great leader 
            and negotiator. While serving with him on the reunion and on the board, 
            I learned many things from him, and we became friends.</p>
          <p>&#147;Ridge believed in honesty and integrity. He was comfortable 
            with himself in any situation and had a way of making you comfortable 
            also. When you were with Ridge on an outing, you realized his love 
            of nature and outdoor activities. If he was sharing one of his life&#146;s 
            experiences or one of his adventures with you, it was a memorable 
            experience.</p>
          <p> &#147;Ridge was a very special person. It is very hard for me to 
            talk just about him, as I think of Ridge and Marjory together. I have 
            never met a couple that complemented each other like they did. They 
            both are so accomplished and yet they never made one feel inadequate. 
            They were what marriage is all about, and they were a perfect example 
            to follow.&#148;</p>
          <p>According to an obituary that appeared in the Arizona Republic on 
            Jan. 7, 2006, Ridge was born on February 25, 1917, in Pilot Grove, 
            Mo. He graduated from the University of Missouri at Columbia in 1939 
            with a Bachelor of Journalism degree. He did post-graduate work at 
            Harvard, the University of Colorado, and Stanford. He served in the 
            U.S. Navy during World War II.</p>
          <p>After the war, Ridge was Creative Director for the advertising firm 
            of BBDO, then a principal of his own agency, Harris, Harlan and Wood. 
            He left advertising to become Assistant Dean and Director of Publications 
            for Stanford University Graduate School of Business. He was then a 
            manager, president, and CEO of numerous companies.</p>
          <p>In more recent years, he was Chairman of LandRay Technology, principal 
            of Harlan Communications, founding investor and principal of Computer 
            Eyes Corporation, and a private investor.</p>
          <p>He is survived by his wife, Marjory, of 30 years; his son, Robert 
            R. Harlan (Harlan Family Association president), of Yuba City, Calif., 
            and his wife Robyn; two daughters, Brooke Williams of Petaluma, Calif.; 
            and Holly Harlan of Granite Bay, Calif.; four grandsons; and two great-grand-daughters.</p>
          <p>Funeral services and interment were held in the National Memorial 
            Cemetery in Phoenix, on January 9, 2006.</p>
          <p>Junior Harlan, who attended the funeral, said that his immediate 
            family, friends, and co-workers all shared many memories of Ridge. 
            &#147;Some were funny, some were personal, but one thing that stood 
            out to me was how much Ridge meant to everyone and how much he had 
            helped all who had contact with him. He was a great teacher,&#148; 
            he said.</p>
          <p>Harlan board member Liz Sly said, &#147;We will miss Ridge. I always 
            admired his get-up-and-go, and he did whatever he was motivated to 
            do &#150; play golf, fly a plane, whatever! He lived life to its fullest.&#148;</p>
          <p>Harlan board member, secretary, and newsletter co-editor Ruth Harlan 
            Lamb remembers when Ridge was coordinator of the Mount Pleasant reunion 
            in 1997. &#147;I typed and mailed the letters that he so carefully 
            composed in longhand. He was able to put a wealth of information in 
            each letter. Ridge contributed much to the strength of the Harlan 
            organization, and we will certainly miss his advice and expertise. 
            He did so much for the Mount Pleasant reunion, he helped finance the 
            tours at the last reunion, and he was a very interested party in the 
            Family organization.&#148;</p>
          <p>Dave and Kim Harlan, Junior&#146;s son and daughter-in-law, said, 
            &#147;We felt blessed in knowing Ridge. He left many life lessons 
            with us. He certainly enriched our lives.&#148;</p>
          <p>&#147;My impression of Ridge was a lot like Junior&#146;s,&#148; 
            said C.J. King, board member and newsletter co-editor. &#147;He was 
            someone I admired very much, and yet he approached me as a complete 
            equal.&#148;</p>
          <p>Bob Harlan said of his father, &#147;Ridge believed in honesty and 
            integrity. Without it, you had nothing.&#148;</p>
          <p>&#147;Those of us who were fortunate to meet Ridge know that he was 
            a Harlan we are all proud to call one of our own,&#148; Junior concluded. 
            &#147;He enriched my life and also that of my family. I have been 
            blessed to know Ridge &#150; he became my mentor and my friend. Ridge 
            was a unique person, and I will miss him.&#148;</p>
          <p>P.S. An interesting note about the names in Ridge&#146;s family &#150; 
            his mother, Dale, had siblings named Glen, Valley and Forest &#150; 
            words of nature and geographic features. Ridge&#146;s children are 
            Brooke, Holly and Robert Ridge. The children of his late brother, 
            Lane, are Timothy, Laurel, Linnet and Heather.</p>

          <p><b>Plans for Harlan Family Reunion</b></p>
          <p>Next year Harlans from all over will be heading to Reno, Nevada, 
            for the big family reunion from Thursday, July 12, to Sunday, July 
            15, 2007. We&#146;ll meet at John Ascuaga&#146;s Nugget Hotel for 
            lots of family-oriented activities and Harlan style fellowship.</p>
          <p>The Board selected Reno for the reunion because of its historical 
            significance and its nearness to many different kinds of recreational 
            activities. The area, originally called Truckee Meadows, was an important 
            stopping point on the California Trail before the emigrant wagon trains 
            made the difficult crossing of the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p>
          <p>Besides an opportunity to meet hundreds of Harlan descendants from 
            all over, the reunion will feature workshops on everything from creating 
            family scrapbooks to examining the connection between the Harlans 
            and the ill-fated Donner Party.</p>
          <p>We&#146;ll gather for a big family picnic at a beautiful park in 
            the area and attend a banquet and hear a presentation on the pioneering 
            family members who helped open up the West. There will be guided bus 
            tours of nearby Virginia City, an old mining town, and Donner Monument 
            near beautiful Lake Tahoe.</p>
          <p>We&#146;ll hold a church service at the reunion and operate a family 
            store for souvenirs and historical material. A self-guided driving 
            tour of historical sites and sight-seeing opportunities in the Reno, 
            Truckee, Lake Tahoe and Carson City area will be available.<br>
            Rooms will be available at the Nugget Hotel, and there are many RV 
            and camping spaces in the Reno area. Reno is convenient to lots of

          <p>T<b>ribute to Maude Harlan Edmonson</b><br>
            <i>Information taken from a tribute by Robert Edminster in The Magpie, 
            Gustine (Calif.) Historical Society</i></p>
          <p>Merced County, Calif., in the San Joaquin Valley was the recipient 
            of many of Maude Harlan Edmonson&#146;s endeavors, and she was described 
            as &#147;a dynamic woman and a life long teacher-administrator who 
            loved California history and travel.&#148; (She recently passed away, 
            but the exact date is unknown.)</p>
          <p>Maude was the grandchild of Elisha Harlan #2995, who, as an 8-year-old 
            boy, came across the plains in 1846 with his father, George #852, 
            and the Harlan Wagon Train.</p>
          <p>Maude was born on a ranch north of the town of Riverdale. The family 
            had a second ranch west of their home on Avenal Creek. Each year at 
            least one cattle drive was necessary, depending on the available food 
            supply. Maude and her brother, Jerome, told many stories about rescuing 
            cattle from islands and levees during high water, while avoiding rattlesnakes 
            brought to the area by the rising water.</p>
          <p>The Harlan cattle drives were family affairs since help was scarce. 
            The family vehicle was driven ahead with supplies and equipment for 
            overnight stopovers. In 1927, when Maude was 13, she began driving 
            the family car with her younger siblings and setting up camp.</p>
          <p>The coordinators of the 2007 Harlan Family Reunion, Pat Fluetsch 
            and William K. Harlan, are kin to this branch of the Harlan family, 
            and they bring a new historical perspective to the upcoming national 
            gathering of Harlans in Reno.</p>

            Harlan Log House Bed and Breakfast, located in Chadds Ford, Pa., chalked 
            up a first last summer. Two separate families of Harlan descendants 
            were guests at the same time. Innkeeper Beverly McCausland said it 
            had never happened before.</p>
          <p>Guest Robert Harlan from Hanover, Kan., descends from George #3 and 
            Ezekiel #5. Ancestors of Paul Kraemer, Centerville, Ohio, the other 
            guest, are George #3 and Aaron #8. Paul&#146;s mother was a Harlan.</p>
          <p>There was a lot of sharing of information between Bob, Paul and Beverly. 
            In addition, Bob, Paul, and his wife, Miriam, visited the nearby Centre 
            Meeting House and burial grounds.</p>
          <p>The log part of the house is original and was built 1715-1720 by 
            Joshua #13, George&#146;s grandson. Additions to the log house were 
            made in 1835 and 1988. To see a photo of the house and grounds, go

          <p><b>Harlans Visit Roots in England and Ireland<br>
            by Katherine B. Harlan</b></p>
          <p>We arrived in Chester, England, by ones, twos and fours on Oct. 17, 
            2005. Thus, 15 members of the Harlan and Hollingsworth families met 
            to begin a trip to explore our heritage in the west of England, Northern 
            Ireland and the Irish Republic. According to records, ancestors of 
            these two families had been friends and neighbors before emigrating 
            to America, and several members of our group claim descent from both 
            lines.</p>
          <p>On the following morning we began our trip through history with a 
            bus ride to Mottram, a town north of Chester, for a visit to St. Michael 
            and All Angels Anglican Church, where Hollingsworths worshipped as 
            early as the 15th century. We also toured Hollingsworth Hall Farm, 
            a site occupied as early as 1022 A.D. and possibly identified in the 
            Domesday Book, a land survey by William the Conquerer, also known 
            as the Doomsday Book.</p>
          <p>For lunch we went to a pub in the ancient village of Tintwistle. 
            Our driver found that the road was not up to demands of large modern 
            motor coaches, and the bus had to be extricated from a precarious 
            position by neighbors with tractor and chains.</p>
          <p>The next stop was Northern Ireland. We left Liverpool airport very 
            early to fly to Belfast and were met by our guide for a bus tour of 
            the city. Belfast is a lovely city with hills on three sides and the 
            harbor on the fourth. The highlight of the day was touring Harland-Wolfe 
            Shipyard, where the Titanic was designed and built. In the main building, 
            we saw the original woodwork, wall friezes and etched glass. The shipyard 
            is now closed, and there are plans to regenerate the property into 
            mixed-use waterfront development called Titanic Quarter.</p>
          <p align="left"><img src="/images/Sir Edward James Harland.jpg" width="200" height="303" align="right" border="1">Prior 
            to meeting the Mayor of Belfast, the group of Harlans gathered on 
            the grounds of City Hall and had our photo taken in front of an imposing 
            statue with this inscription:<br>
            <i>Sir Edward James Harland<br>
            Engineer and Shipbuilder<br>
            And<br>
            M.P. for Belfast-North<br>
            1895<br>
            Erected by his numerous friends.</i></p>
          <p>From Belfast we drove west to Armagh, said to be the oldest city 
            in Ireland. Here, there are two beautiful cathedrals, one Church of 
            Ireland and one Roman Catholic, both dedicated to St. Patrick. Near 
            Armagh is the town of Lurgan, and we were entertained there at the 
            Meeting House by members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). 
            The Hollingsworths became Quakers while in Ireland, prior to emigrating, 
            and we learned about the 300-year history of the Meeting.</p>
          <p>Afterward we had a delightful lunch and visit with members of the 
            congregation and then drove to the Lynastown burial ground, which 
            dated to 1658. At least three Harlans are interred there: Katherine, 
            widow of Thomas, in 1689; Peter, in 1691; and Peter&#146;s widow, 
            Mary, in 1700.</p>
          <p>Our tour then went south to Dublin, with a stop at the Hill of Tara, 
            known as the seat of the High Kings of Ireland. Legend says that St. 
            Patrick met here with the Druids and began the conversion of Ireland 
            to Christianity. In Dublin we visited Christ Church Cathedral. There 
            have been many restorations of the present building, but the original 
            church was established on the site in the 11th century. The last Dublin 
            stop was at Trinity College to see the dramatic exhibit of Irish medieval 
            gospel manuscripts, the Book of Kells.</p>
          <p>Leaving Dublin, we drove through the Wicklow Mountains to Glendalough, 
            a 6th century monastic retreat established by St. Kevin. The buildings 
            that remain include a tall circular tower and a stone structure that 
            was probably used as a church. After lunch we visited the small town 
            of Wexford where Commodore Barry of American Revolutionary fame was 
            born. A statue of him is on the waterfront.</p>
          <p>Waterford, our next stop, was founded by the Vikings, who gave it 
            the name of Water-fjord, and it is renowned for production of fine 
            crystal. We visited the factory, watched the artisans at work and 
            shopped in the show rooms.</p>
          <p>Our next stop was Kilkenny, to tour the restored castle before returning 
            to Dublin for the night.</p>
          <p>Our tour closed with Irish Night, a farewell dinner and show, featuring 
            Irish dancing and songs. We all joined in on &#147;The Wild Rover&#148; 
            and &#147;Goodbye, Tipperary&#148; before saying goodbye to each other, 
            with happy memories and wishes for a safe trip home.</p>
          <p>Travelers on the tour included John and Annette Harlan of Augusta, 
            Ga., and their daughters, Nancy Gooding of Evans, Ga., and Jane Beson 
            of Summerville, S.C.; Vijay and Susan H. Aggarwal of Malvern, Pa.; 
            Mary Harlan Murphy of Wayne, Pa.; Jo Hollingsworth of Fostoria, Ohio; 
            Carey and Kellene Hardy of Richardson, Texas; Suzanne McClelland of 
            McLean, Va.; Katherine Harlan of Vienna, Va.; Susan Woosnam of New 
            York City; George McKnight of Hamburg, N.Y.; and Marge Sgroi of Orchard 
            Park, N.Y. Many thanks go out to Marge; to our excellent driver in 
            Ireland, Michael Roony; and to the guides who were so helpful in Belfast, 
            Armagh, and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

          <p><b>The Irish Interlude<br>
            Part III: Religious Struggles</b></p>
          <p><i>(Editor&#146;s Note: The Spring and Fall 2005 issues of The Harlan 
            Record have featured an edited version of a long article on the years

            the link, &#147;Irish Interlude&#148; on the Harlan Web site.)</i></p>
          <p>By John H. Harland</p>
          <p>Religion overarches everything, and our story about the Harlan brothers 
            in Ireland can only be viewed in the context of the religious turmoil 
            that characterized the 17th and 18th centuries. The historical record 
            is far from tidy and it is impossible to list and analyze the interrelationships 
            of all the denominations that arose in a period of intense spiritual 
            hunger and intellectual ferment, but here are the main points.</p>
          <p>Catholicism: The Roman Catholic Church was the spiritual ancestor 
            of all the other Christian sects in this story. In the 16th century, 
            Martin Luther and Henry VIII had, for quite different reasons, broken 
            with the Papal authorities. In England, the Church of England, at 
            whose head stood the Monarch, was the official state religion, but 
            in 1603, at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, the &#147;Old 
            Religion&#148; was far from extirpated in England, and the Church 
            of England&#146;s position correspondingly far from secure.</p>
          <p>Upon his accession in 1603, James I was inclined to be tolerant, 
            but the Gunpowder Plot of 1605 permanently hardened his attitude, 
            and the adherents of the Old Religion and especially its priests were 
            extremely roughly handled.</p>
          <p>In England by 1687, oppressive measures had been successful in reducing 
            Catholics to a minority position, but in Ireland, the people had no 
            reason to acknowledge a new religious leader, and both peasants (Old 
            Irish) and landowners (Old English) stubbornly clung to their Catholic 
            faith, this despite the fact that Irish Catholics had been oppressed 
            from Tudor times. Things got much worse following the uprising of 
            1641, and following the Williamite wars fifty years later, when a 
            succession of brutally oppressive and unjust Penal Laws made the lot 
            of the Irish Catholics nearly impossible. These actions and others 
            generated resentments that reverberate to the present day.</p>
          <p><b>Church of England and Church of Ireland: </b>These were the &#147;Established&#148; 
            state religions, and thus had the authority to extract &#147;tithes&#148; 
            from the citizens in each parish. Below, we will take note of the 
            fashion in which this ecclesiastical tax impacted the Brothers.</p>
          <p><b>Puritans and Presbyterians:</b> English Puritans came to New England 
            in 1620 and, as the Pilgrim Fathers, played an important role in the 
            early history of America. In the homeland, the influence of the Puritan 
            wing of the Church of England increased to the point where they gained 
            control of Parliament, and step by step, this led to Civil War, which 
            started in 1642, and ended with the beheading of Charles I in 1649.</p>
          <p>Following the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, some Puritans 
            remained with the Church of England, establishing the Low Church tradition 
            within it, while others broke away to form the Presbyterian and other 
            Protestant denominations.</p>
          <p>In Scotland, the key figure in establishment of the Presbyterian 
            Church was John Knox, who was himself greatly influenced by Swiss 
            Calvinism. The Scottish Presbyterians are important to our story because 
            they comprised the majority of the settlers involved in the colonization 
            of Ulster. They supported the Parliament during the Civil War, signing 
            a Covenant in 1643, but subsequently had a falling out with Cromwell.</p>
          <p>During the reign of James II, at almost exactly the time the Brothers 
            left Ireland, the Presbyterians in Scotland were being cruelly treated 
            by the authorities, particularly by Graham of Claverhouse &#150; an 
            era remembered as &#147;the Killing Times.&#146;&#146;</p>
          <p><b>The Society of Friends:</b> George and Michael Harlan were members 
            of the Society of Friends, or Quakers, and since this particular Christian 
            sect has special significance in the story of the Harlan Family, we 
            will consider it in some detail. The movement was founded by George 
            Fox (1624-91), and at the time of its inception, it was just one among 
            many dissenting sects of the day, like the Diggers, Seekers, Ranters, 
            Muggletonians, etc., all of which are today just footnotes in the 
            history of religion.</p>
          <p>Although it never had a huge number of adherents, Quakerism influenced 
            society and events in 17th and 18th century Britain and in the early 
            history of the American colonies, far out of proportion to the size 
            of the denomination. A period of very active proselytizing followed 
            the movement&#146;s founding in 1647, with preachers spreading the 
            word in England and Ireland, and traveling to Germany, the Netherlands 
            and the American Colonies.</p>
          <p>William Edmundson convened the very first Quaker meeting in Ireland 
            in Lurgan in 1655. He was known as &#147;The Great Hammer of Ireland,&#148; 
            a remarkably muscular nickname for a peace-loving Quaker, but one 
            that reflected his temperament and military background. Edmundson 
            had served in the Cromwellian army and went on to achieve fame in 
            Ireland and beyond, as a preacher in his own right. He had much to 
            do with the establishment of Quakerism in North Carolina. It is reasonable 
            to ascribe, at least in part, the Harlans&#146; specific choice of 
            the Lurgan area as the place to settle, to their awareness of a significant 
            Quaker presence there.</p>
          <p>Later on, the Quaker movement lost its missionary zeal, ceasing to 
            seek converts, and developing a tendency to exclusivity together with 
            an obsession with internal discipline. In America, a series of disastrous 
            schisms split the movement, and congregations dwindled as members 
            drifted away to other denominations, or in the worst case were &#147;cast 
            out&#148; or &#147;disowned&#148; when they disagreed with the elders, 
            often over relatively trivial matters.</p>
          <p>Things were quite different in Quakerism&#146;s early days, with 
            the first wave of converts, like the Harlan brothers, being much more 
            engaged in enthusiastic proselytizing. Paradoxically, this period 
            of exponential growth was also the era in which the Friends were obliged 
            to endure the most vicious persecution.</p>
          <p>In England, Quakers were the target of a series of oppressive legislative 
            measures passed between 1662 and 1665, including the Quaker Act, the 
            Five-Mile Act, the Test Act, and the Conventicle Acts, and it is said 
            that more than 300 Friends died in jail, and 200 were transported 
            as slaves to the West Indies.</p>
          <p>It was not until 1689 that these oppressive laws were repealed with 
            the passage of the Toleration Act, but in the meantime many Quakers 
            had been severely mistreated. Nor was persecution limited to England. 
            In America, the Puritan authorities of Massachusetts found the Quaker 
            beliefs and practices to be particularly objectionable, and in 1659 
            they went so far as to hang four Quakers on Boston Common.</p>
          <p>Principle is one thing, and money is another, and from the authorities&#146; 
            point of view, failure of the Quakers to pay tithes was the last straw. 
            &#147;Tithes,&#148; nominally a tenth of one&#146;s income, can be 
            thought of as a church tax, and were the main source of income for 
            the Established Church. As non-Anglicans, Quakers regarded tithing 
            as a rank injustice, and. by refusing to pay up, they laid themselves 
            open to prosecution. Because of inertia, folk tend to resign themselves 
            to this sort of injustice, but when pushed beyond a certain point, 
            like the Israelites departing the land of Egypt, they decide to vote 
            with their feet. Those offenders lucky enough to escape jail had crops 
            or property forcibly seized in lieu of payment, and opposition to 
            tithing undoubtedly explains why many early Quakers pulled up stakes 
            and headed for greener pastures.</p>
          <p>This process sometimes involved a series of such removes, and the 
            Brothers&#146; peregrinations fit this pattern. As it happens in their 
            case, we can back this up with a contemporary news item: &#147;In 
            1680, George Harland, of County Down had taken from him in Tithe, 
            by Daniel MacConnell, twelve stooks and a half of oats, three stooks 
            and a half of barley, and five loads of hay, all worth ten shillings 
            and ten pence&#148; [from William Stockdale, &#147;A Great Cry of 
            Oppression,&#148; cited by A.C. Myers in Immigration of the Irish 
            Quakers into Pennsylvania 1682-1750, p. 321].</p>
          <p>Quakers believed in plain speech and plain dress; titles were not 
            used, nor hats doffed as a token of respect; they addressed each other 
            as &#147;thee&#148; and &#147;thou&#148; instead of &#147;you,&#148; 
            and the Quaker gray of their clothing, unadorned by lapels or fancy 
            buttons, together with their flat hats, made the Quakers recognizable 
            from afar.</p>
          <p>Denied careers in the military, academic or professional world, they 
            gravitated into business and manufacturing, where because of abstemious 
            life style, willingness to work long hours, refusal to haggle, and 
            punctiliousness about keeping their word and meeting their obligations, 
            many achieved considerable financial success.</p>
          <p>In America, the story of the Friends is inextricably bound with the 
            foundation of Pennsylvania and the career of Sir William Penn, the 
            Younger. His father, Admiral Sir William Penn (1621-1670), was a professional 
            naval officer, who survived the political pitfalls which beset his 
            Navy colleagues during the Commonwealth period, but became involved 
            with the Restoration of 1660, returning Charles II to the throne of 
            England.</p>
          <p>While superintending the family estates in Ireland, his son William 
            Penn (1644-1718) became a Quaker. He proselytized actively there, 
            and it is not inconceivable that the Harlans heard him preach in Lurgan.</p>
          <p>Admiral Penn had loaned 12,000 pounds to King Charles when the latter 
            was in financial straits, and in 1681, to settle this obligation, 
            Penn&#146;s son persuaded the King to grant him a tract of land west 
            of the Delaware River, 40,000 square miles in extent, roughly including 
            modern Pennsylvania and Delaware. Penn&#146;s plan was to found a 
            colony based on Quaker principles, a &#147;Holy Experiment&#148; as 
            he called it, and starting in 1681, broadsheets promoting the venture 
            were distributed widely at Quaker meetings in Ireland, prompting a 
            trickle of pioneers who set off to the New World.</p>
          <p>A.C. Myers suggests that in the next few years there was considerable 
            interaction between the Colony and Ireland, with people going back 
            and forth, and letters that described life in America being passed 
            from hand to hand at Quaker Meetings. Thus the members of the Lurgan 
            Meeting all knew of the Colony, and it is not difficult to see how 
            George and Michael Harlan became persuaded that their future lay across 
            the ocean.</p>
          <p>Some Irish Quakers went out to the Colony as indentured servants, 
            but the Brothers had enough money to purchase land before they left 
            Ireland. As relatively early arrivals, they bought and settled on 
            land in the eastern part of the territory, near modern-day New Castle, 
            Delaware, near Brandywine Creek.</p>
          <p>Quaker dominance in the affairs of Pennsylvania was to continue until 
            the latter half of the 18th Century, when during the Indian Wars and 
            the subsequent War of Independence, their unwillingness to bear arms 
            brought them into conflict with the spirit of the times.<br>

            While sitting on a plane, prior to taking off for the 2005 Harlan 
            board meeting in Sacramento, two board members looked out the window 
            and noticed a small tractor with &#147;HARLAN&#148; stenciled on the 
            front end.</p>
          <p>After returning home and checking the Internet, there appears to 
            be no connection to the Harlan Family. Harlan Corporation evolved 
            from the vision of its founder, Jim Kaplan, who grew up in Sioux City, 
            Iowa.</p>
          <p>After he attended college and served in the Armed Forces, Jim moved 
            to Kansas City, Kans., and in 1958 he founded his corporation to rent 
            and rebuild lift trucks. After much analysis, he redesigned the machinery 
            and its components and was soon selling parts all over the world. 
            His towing tractors move the biggest and heaviest commercial loads 
            and are used by airlines, auto manufacturers, and the U.S. government. 
            Even the Egyptian Air Force has over 250 Harlan tractors.</p>
          <p>Next time you&#146;re waiting on a plane, look out the window and 
            see if there&#146;s a machine with a name dear to our hearts.</p>

          <p><b>May Day Singing, Sunday, May 7</b></p>
          <p>Since 1887, Harlan descendants have gathered at the Blue Ridge Baptist 
            Church on the first Sunday of May to participate in the church&#146;s 
            annual &#147;May Day Singing.&#148; Harlan family members, descendants 
            and friends are invited to attend.</p>
          <p>This year&#146;s event will be held Sunday, May 7, from 10 a.m. until 
            3 p.m. The semi-annual meeting of the Blue Ridge Cemetery Association 
            will immediately follow at 3 p.m. The cemetery includes mostly Harlan 
            descendants and their spouses.</p>
          <p>Presently undergoing extensive renovation, the Blue Ridge Baptist 
            Church, along with the cemetery, sits on 28 acres of land deeded in 
            1873 by George Harlan for the establishment of a church. The site 
            was part of a land grant given by Mexico to George&#146;s father, 
            Dr. Isaiah Harlan, in 1835. The church is beautifully located about 
            ten miles east of Marlin, Texas, on FM Road 1771.</p>

            The caption under the photo of Eliza Harlan Cross Tannehill Dunlap 
            Sims, on page one of the Fall 2005 issue of The Harlan Record, states 
            that it was taken at the time of her marriage to Joseph Cross, her 
            first husband.</p>
          <p>Actually, the photo was taken much later, when Eliza was 60 years 
            old. At the time, her name was Eliza Dunlap.</p>
          <p>Also, Margaret Rose Dunlap (page 6, same story) was the daughter 
            of John Dunlap, not Sam Dunlap, his brother (and Eliza&#146;s husband). 
            Margaret was thus the niece of Eliza, not her stepdaughter.</p>

          <p><b>GENEALOGY CORNER<br>
            HARLAN NUMBERING SYSTEM &#150; PATERNAL OR MATERNAL?</b></p>
          <p>Recently, an inquiry came to the attention of our genealogy committee 
            about an individual who has Harlan ancestors on both the paternal 
            and maternal lines. The question was raised about which ancestor to 
            use in numbering the descendants. This is not the first time this 
            situation has occurred. The decision is that the paternal line should 
            be used as the primary ancestor. When the generations progress to 
            where the two lines actually connect, the maternal line will be recognized 
            at that point.</p>
          <p>The Harlans have chosen to use a descending system that begins with 
            the remote ancestors and moves forward in time to the current generations. 
            This is the numbering system used by Alpheus Harlan. He states in 
            his &#147;Explanations&#148; page, at the beginning of the book, in 
            paragraph three, that &#147;the numerical system is almost universally 
            used, this being most convenient, besides conforming to usage of Friends.&#148;</p>
          <p>This system is what is referred to as the NGSQ (National Genealogical 
            Society Quarterly) numbering system, with all children being assigned 
            a number.</p>
          <p>To update your line, the committee recommends that each family use 
            the number of the last member of their line that is listed in the 
            History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family and expand on that number. 
            Example: my last listed ancestor is John #6326. My grandfather, George, 
            was John&#146;s fifth child, so his number is #6326-5. My mother, 
            Virginia, was George&#146;s second child, so her number is #6326-52. 
            I am my mother&#146;s second child, so my number is #6326-522. This 
            seems to be the most logical method to perpetuate the original numbering 
            system.</p>
