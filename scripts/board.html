    <p>Mary’s paternal grandparents were both descendants of George Harlan. Her grandfather gathered much of the Chester County information on the early Harlans from County and Friends Meeting records and sent them to Alpheus Harlan for inclusion in the "Green Book". So, to her, genealogy has been a life-long interest.</p><p>Mary was born in Pennsylvania and his lived in the area where the first Harlans settled all her life. After receiving a BA from Rosemont College and an MA from Villanova University , she taught Mathematics for 11 years before changing careers, going to Medical School and then practicing Emergency Medicine until retirement. Her husband, William Murphy, died after 40 years of wonderful marriage. Besides genealogy, Mary’s interests include travel, reading, cooking and involvement with her church community.</p>

    <p>Fred has been interested in Harlan history since a young age having been introduced to it by his grandfather David Franklin Harlan, who was raised in the western Pa. village of Harlansburg. David had a taped together paper family tree that took up most of the room when rolled out. Fred remembers many times studying that document.</p><p>With Jim and Sue Harlan, his uncle and aunt, already involved with the Harlan Family in America, Fred volunteered to take over maintaining the Harlan Family genealogy database from Ester Wells in 2006. The first reunion Fred attended was the 2007 Reno reunion, while many of his immediate family attended Reunion 300 in 1987. Being encouraged by Junior Harlan, Fred joined the Board in 2011.

    <p>Bob Walters became a board member in 2020. Bob's mother, Louise Myers Harlan, descendent of Michael Harlan, was born in Stanton, DE, not far from where George and Michael originally settled. Although Louise was aware of the history of the Harlans in the U.S., she never had the opportunity to attend a national reunion. Unfortunate, because she would have loved to meet and come to know her many Harlan cousins. Bob attended the 2002 reunion with his family in Wilmington, DE which motivated him to learn more of the family history. Bob and his wife Denise joined the Harlan Tour of England and Northern Ireland in 2018 and count it among their best and most memorable trips.</p><p>Bob and Denise reside in Blue Bell, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. Bob worked for IQVIA, formerly IMS Health, for over 25 years, primarily in program and project management for product development. Denise works as a Data Base Administrator for Cerner. He and Denise are heavily involved in their church, First Presbyterian of Ambler and volunteer for several other local non-profits.

            <h3>Peggy Harlan Hewitt</h3>
            <p>For as long as I can remember by Father cherished the Harlan family geneology papers handed down from his Mother, Mary Harlan. His father and brother were avid genealogists researching their Johnson family ties also. I was born in Philadelphia, Pa. and attended Friends Central School for High School, in that city.</p><p>I graduated from Eastern University in St. Davids, Pa. with a degree in Psychology. My first employment as an adult was at Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia, and then the Camden County, NJ. Welfare board as a social worker.  My husband, Bob, and I have two grown sons, and 5 grandchildren.</p><p>My interests in addition to family history include working for several charities, quilting, reading, golf, and bocce. We live now in Lebanon, OH.</p>

            <h3>Mary Harlan Murphy</h3>
            <p>Mary’s paternal grandparents were both descendants of George Harlan. Her grandfather gathered much of the Chester County information on the early Harlans from County and Friends Meeting records and sent them to Alpheus Harlan for inclusion in the "Green Book". So, to her, genealogy has been a life-long interest.</p><p>Mary was born in Pennsylvania and his lived in the area where the first Harlans settled all her life. After receiving a BA from Rosemont College and an MA from Villanova University , she taught Mathematics for 11 years before changing careers, going to Medical School and then practicing Emergency Medicine until retirement. Her husband, William Murphy, died after 40 years of wonderful marriage. Besides genealogy, Mary’s interests include travel, reading, cooking and involvement with her church community.</p>

            <h3>Dorothy Harlan Sperry</h3>
            <p>Dorothy Harlan Sperry came on the Board in 2011. Dorothy’s father, James Udell Harlan, was born near and raised in Salisbury, MO. After WWII, he moved the family from St. Louis, MO to Clarinda, IA, where Dorothy was born and grew up. She graduated from Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, with a B.S. in Institution Management—School Food Service. As a Registered Licensed Dietitian, she worked as a Consultant Dietitian in small hospitals and long term care centers, had a private practice with a fellow dietitian, taught at two community colleges, and was a therapeutic dietitian in a medium security men’s prison.</p><p>Dorothy has always had a strong interest in food and cooking, and her first duty with the Harlan Family organization was to plan and coordinate the meals for the national reunion held in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa in 1997.  She has also compiled/edited both editions of the Harlan Family Favorite Recipes cookbooks.  Dorothy and her husband, Bob, live in Ames and Bob is a retired civil engineer.

            <h3>Robert C. Walters</h3>
            <p>Bob Walters became a board member in 2020. Bob's mother, Louise Myers Harlan, descendent of Michael Harlan, was born in Stanton, DE, not far from where George and Michael originally settled. Although Louise was aware of the history of the Harlans in the U.S., she never had the opportunity to attend a national reunion. Unfortunate, because she would have loved to meet and come to know her many Harlan cousins. Bob attended the 2002 reunion with his family in Wilmington, DE which motivated him to learn more of the family history. Bob and his wife Denise joined the Harlan Tour of England and Northern Ireland in 2018 and count it among their best and most memorable trips.</p><p>Bob and Denise reside in Blue Bell, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia. Bob worked for IQVIA, formerly IMS Health, for over 25 years, primarily in program and project management for product development. Denise works as a Data Base Administrator for Cerner. He and Denise are heavily involved in their church, First Presbyterian of Ambler and volunteer for several other local non-profits. They enjoy traveling, hiking, museums and especially, spending time with their adult children and other family.</p>
