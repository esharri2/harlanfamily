			  Harlan Lincoln, and their children.		    </p>
			<p>A dedication ceremony was 
			  held Sunday, April 26, 2009, in the 
			  beautifully restored home of Senator 
			  James Harlan on the campus of 
			  Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount 
			  Pleasant, Iowa. Executive Director

			<h2><a name="marjorie"></a>Remembering Marjorie Harlan</h2>
			<p>Marjory Harlan (CA) passed away in April 2009 after 
			  a long illness at the age of 83. Marjory and her late husband, 
			  Ridge Latimer Harlan, were ardent supporters of the 
			  Harlan Family in America and were also generous philanthropists 
			  with donations to several of our family reunions.		    </p>
			<p>Marjory worked for more than 50 years as a 
			  psychiatrist in the San Francisco area and later donated 
			  professional time to American Indian organizations in 
			  Arizona. She was also &ldquo;mother&rdquo; to hundreds of young 
			  women through her establishment of group homes for 
			  wayward teens in San Francisco.		    </p>
			<p>Marjory is survived by her children Brooke, Holly 
			  and Bob (current Harlan association president), a brother, 
			  nieces and nephews, and many grandchildren. 
			  The family requests that donations be made in her 
			  memory to The Harlan Family in America.</p>

<h2><a name="blue"></a>Hildeneʼs Efforts 
	to Restore
	the Sunbeam</h2>
<p> Hildene, the Harlan-Lincoln 
	home in Manchester, Vt., is in the 
	midst of a project to restore one of 
	the original Pullman railroad cars, 
	the &ldquo;Sunbeam.&rdquo; Robert Todd 
	Lincoln, husband of Mary Harlan 
	Lincoln and son of the Civil War 
	President, was president of the 
	Pullman Company when the 
	Sunbeam was built, in 1903.	</p>
<p>The Friends of Hildene 
	acquired the railroad car after an 
	extensive search for the most 
	authentic example of a Pullman car 
	built during RTL's tenure with the 
	company. The car had not been 
	substantially altered through the 
	years, and once the restoration is 
	complete, the Sunbeam will be the 
	finest example of a wooden 
	Pullman car on public display. It 
	will be brought to Hildene to serve 
	as an educational tool to help teach 
	about railroad history, the Gilded 
	Age, the labor movement, and the 
	Industrial Revolution in America. </p>
<p>Hildene has been offered a 
	generous $400,000 match if 
	another $400,000 can be raised by 
	the end of 2009. A substantial 
	portion of that match has been 
	raised, but help is still needed. 
	With these funds, Hildene will be 
	able to complete the restoration 
	project. Hopefully, the newly restored 
	Sunbeam will be brought 
	to Hildene in the summer of 2010.	</p>
<p>If you would like to make a 
	donation to this project, contact 
	Friends of Hildene at P.O. Box 
	377, Manchester, VT 05254, or 
	call 1-800-578-1788. For more

<h3><a name="pleasant"></a>Discovering Michael Harlan</h3>
<h4> by Lynne Carroll, descendant of 
	Michael Harlan (#4)	</h4>
<p>I had never heard the story of 
	my mother&rsquo;s father, Richard W. 
	Harlan, until after her death in 1986. 
	She was the last of Richard&rsquo;s 
	children.	</p>
<p>Stuck to the back of her old 
	desk was an envelope containing a 
	few old news clippings. One, in 
	particular, caught my attention. It 
	was an older gentleman on 
	horseback, Dr. George C. Harlan. 
	As I read it, it was his obituary. Dr. 
	Harlan was a nationally recognized 
	ophthalmologist affiliated with the 
	Wills Eye Hospital and the 
	University of Pennsylvania in 
	Philadelphia. He was a surgeon 
	with the 11th Pennsylvania Calvary 
	during the Civil War. My grandfather 
	was George C. Harlan&rsquo;s 
	grandson.	</p>
<p>Into this family came my 
	grandmother as a nanny to the 
	younger Harlan children. She told 
	me she had come into Ellis Island at 
	the age of 14 to be a nanny for this 
	family. During this time, she and 
	Richard apparently fell in love. My 
	grandmother returned to Switzerland 
	when her job was completed. 
	She later came through Ellis Island 
	a second time to marry Richard.	</p>
<p>Apparently Richard was 
	disinherited by his family because 
	of this marriage. They had nine 
	children, my mother being the 
	youngest. From what I have 
	discovered, my grandfather Richard 
	was born in 1877 and died in 1915. 
	I do not know the date of my 
	grandparents&rsquo; wedding. My mother, 
	Theresa Elizabeth, was born in 
	1904.	</p>
<p>Until I found this envelope, I 
	just had no thought of finding out 
	about Harlans. However, I am a 
	Civil War buff, and this piqued my 
	interest.	</p>
<p>I was at a clear disadvantage 
	since my grandmother and mother 
	never talked about that side of the 
	family, because I am sure it was a 
	scandal at the time. 
	While living in southern 
	Chester County, Pa., I knew of the 
	Harlan Log House and started 
	there. I discovered that George and 
	Michael Harlan came to this 
	country from Ireland and landed in 
	New Castle, Del. I then heard about 
	The Harlan Family of America and 
	joined the group.	</p>
<p>I understand that I am unique 
	because most Harlans are related to 
	George.</p>
<h3> <a name="hallows"></a>A Note to Friends 
	of All Hallows, 
	Sutton on the 
	Forest</h3>
<p> A thank-you letter was received 
	for the Harlan Family&rsquo;s contributions 
	toward the restoration of 
	the Harland memorials in All 
	Hallows Church, Sutton on the 
	Forest in England.	</p>
<p>Two monuments were taken 
	down in May for repairs and 
	should be back in place now. The 
	restoration project to repair all of 
	the memorials may take 20-30 
	years.	</p>
<p>Derek Jacobs, Chairman of 
	Friends of All Hallows Trust, will 
	be happy to show the Church to 
	any Harlan Family visitors if they 
	contact him by e-mail a few days 
	before coming. 
	Derek&rsquo;s e-mail address is:

<h2><a name="talented"></a>Richard Harlan (#1199): 
	A Friend of John James 
	Audubon</h2>
<h4> 
	By Ç. J. King 
	Harlan Record Editor	</h4>
<p>Submissions for this issue of 
	the Harlan Record were lighter 
	than usual, so I was searching for 
	an interesting Harlan to write about. 
	After spotting a hawk in my back 
	yard, I consulted my field guide to 
	identify it. While reading, I found a 
	listing for the Harlan’s Hawk. 
	Have you heard of the Harlan’s 
	Hawk and wondered if it was 
	named after a Harlan? It turns out 
	that it was.</p>
<p> According to Guide to Field 
	Identification: Birds of North 
	America (Golden Press, 1966), the 
	Harlan’s Hawk is fairly rare and 
	one of the most difficult birds to 
	identify. It strongly resembles the 
	Red-Tailed Hawk and is sometimes 
	considered a subspecies of that 
	bird. The Red-Tailed Hawk is 
	known for its ruddy-colored tail; 
	the Harlan’s Hawk’s tail is mottled 
	dark brown on white, with a dark 
	band across the bottom, The 
	Harlan’s Hawk is also easily 
	confused with the Rough-Legged 
	Hawk and the Ferruginous Hawk.	</p>
<p>Red-Tailed Hawks are common 
	year-round in most of the United 
	States, except the Upper Midwest 
	and the western states bordering 
	Canada. The Harlan’s Hawk has a 
	much narrower range, wintering in 
	Texas, then migrating up through 
	the Plains and summering in 
	Northwestern Canada and southern 
	Alaska.</p>
<p> According to a book review by 
	Richard Bierregaard Jr., posted on 
	the Univ. of North Carolina’s 
	Dept. of Biology Web site, 
	John James Audubon (1785-1851) 
	missed an opportunity to see the 
	Harlan’s Hawk in the field and had 
	to be satisfied with studying the 
	bird from specimens brought back 
	from someone else’s western 
	expedition. A somewhat conflicting 
	story appears on the 
	www.audubon.org Web site, where 
	Audubon relates about capturing a 
	sample of the species. In either 
	case, Audubon named the newly 
	discovered bird after Dr. Richard 
	Harlan, a noted physician and 
	zoologist from Philadelphia.	</p>
<p>Audubon’s respect for Dr. 
	Harlan is evident in the following 
	quote, taken from Audubon’s 
	commentary about the bird: "Long 
	before I discovered this fine Hawk, 
	I was anxious to have an opportunity 
	of honouring some new 
	species of the feathered tribe with 
	the name of my excellent friend Dr. 
	Richard Harlan of Philadelphia. 
	This I might have done sooner, had 
	I not waited until a species should 
	occur, which in its size and 
	importance should bear some 
	proportion to my gratitude toward 
	that learned and accomplished 
	friend." (www.audubon.org/bird/boa/F2_G2d.html)	</p>
<p>For a quick biography of 
	Richard Harlan, I consulted Wikipedia. 
	I found very little information, 
	but I did find birth and death 
	dates, which helped me find the 
	right Richard Harlan in the Alpheus 
	Harlan book. He first appears on 
	page 139, one of the sons of Joshua 
	Harlan (#306). He appears again on 
	page 335, where we learn that he 
	was a physician and a Quaker, born 
	on Sept. 19, 1796, in Philadelphia. 
	According to Alpheus, Dr. Harlan 
	survived a cholera epidemic in 
	Philadelphia in 1832, during which 
	he "rendered noble service to his

<h2><a name="sergeant"></a>Double Harlan Ancestry</h2>
<h4>Editor’s note: The following is 
	from the link, “Stories,” on the 
	Harlan family’s Web site.</h4>
<p> “My parents are also my 
	cousins.” This sounds like the 
	beginning of a riddle, but it is a true 
	story. </p>
<p>Dorothy Harlan Wear has 
	Harlan ancestors on both sides of 
	her family.</p>
<p> Reuben M. Harlan’s (#2729) 
	first marriage and family are 
	documented in Alpheus Harlan’s 
	genealogy book. But not in the 
	book is his second marriage to 
	Cynthia Darnell. They had five 
	children: James, Reuben Smith, 
	Mattie, Cynthia, and Susan. Reuben 
	Smith is Dorothy’s great-grandfather 
	on her father’s side, and 
	Mattie is her great-grandmother on 
	her mother’s side. Reuben Smith 
	Harlan married Frances Ida Darnell, 
	the niece of Cynthia Darnell. They 
	had a son, Reuben Lee Harlan, who 
	had a son, Lee Isadore Harlan— 
	Lee was Dorothy’s father.	</p>
<p>Mattie Harlan, Reuben Smith’s 
	sister, married Christopher Kessler, 
	and they had a daughter, Margaret, 
	who had a daughter Rosa Lee. Rosa 
	Lee was Dorothy’s mother and the 
	wife of Lee Isadore Harlan. 
	Dorothy says it took almost twenty 
	years to confirm the stories of how 
	her mom and dad are related. 
	“This is how my parents are 
	cousins, making me a third cousin 
	to my parents, I do believe,” 
	Dorothy writes.</p>
<p> Dorothy and her three sisters, 
	JoAnn, Frances, and Evelyn, were 
	born and grew up in Los Angeles 
	County, Calif., but her parents were 
	born in Louisville, Ky. Dorothy 
	now lives in Washougal, Wash.	</p>
<p>Perhaps Dorothy’s double-dose 
	of common Quaker ancestry is one 
	reason she was involved with a 
	caring volunteer organization— 
	AmeriCorps VISTA. It is a federal 
	program that is sponsored by 
	various groups in the United States 
	such as the Red Cross and Kiwanis. 
	Dorothy’s volunteer service was 
	supported by the City of Vancouver’s 
	(WA) Retired and Senior 
	Volunteer Program. Volunteers 
	receive stipend wages and agree to 
	serve one or two years.</p>

	Millerman, and five siblings all 
	established homesteads on that 
	land, and there are now hundreds

<h3>How Texas Aided 
	the American 
	Revolution</h3>
<h4> By Tom Powers	</h4>
<p><i><img src="/record/images/35harlanbooks.jpg" alt="Other Books of Interest" width="292" height="974" align="right" style="padding-left:10px;">The Texas Connection with the 
	American Revolution</i>, by Robert H. 
	Thornhoff, was published in 2000 
	by Eakin Press of Austin.	</p>
<p>The Provinces of Texas were 
	settled by the Spanish, who built 
	missions along the San Antonio 
	and Guadalupe River valley areas. 
	According to Wikipedia, in addition 
	to spreading the Christian 
	faith, the missions were also 
	charged with spreading the 
	Spanish culture into the New 
	World and with giving Spain a 
	toehold of power there. As many 
	as 26 missions existed in the area 
	now called Texas at some point 
	between the 1400s and the 1800s. 
	Each mission had large ranches 
	where they raised herds of longhorn 
	cattle, sheep, horses and 
	mules. Some farming was done 
	along the rivers where crops could 
	be irrigated.	</p>
<p>Bernardo de Galvez, a young 
	military officer who served in the 
	Spanish army in the northern 
	provinces of New Spain, became 
	familiar with the mission ranches 
	during campaigns against the 
	Indians in 1770. Eventually he was 
	the general of the Spanish forces 
	in New Spain.	</p>
<p>He returned to Spain and 
	France for further training, and in 
	1776, he was appointed governor 
	of the Province of Louisiana, 
	which was then controlled by 
	Spain. From there, he began to aid 
	the Americans in their battle with 
	the English, even before Spain 
	declared war on Britain. Gun 
	powder, lead, rifles, clothing, etc., 
	were supplied to the colonists 
	through the port of New Orleans.	</p>
<p>When a hurricane devastated 
	the cattle herds of Louisiana, 
	causing a shortage of beef to feed 
	the armies and a lack of replacement 
	animals for the farms, Galvez 
	remembered the vast herds in 
	Texas, and requested immediate 
	delivery of thousands of cattle and 
	horses to Opelousas, La. The first 
	record of Texas longhorn cattle 
	being driven to supply Galvez 
	forces in Louisiana was in August 
	1779, when 2000 head had been 
	gathered from ranches in the 
	Bexar-LaBahia areas (60 miles or 
	so north of Corpus Christi). 
	Many more herds of various sizes 
	followed during the years 1780- 
	1784. This supply of cattle, horses, 
	and mules aided the Spanish and 
	American armies in defeating the 
	English. Thus The Texas Connection!	</p>
<p>Galvez eventually led the 
	Spanish armies to defeat the 
	British at Pensacola, recapturing 
	Florida for Spain. He spent the 
	last two years as viceroy of New 
	Spain, succeeding his father in that 
	role. Galveston, Texas, is named 
	for him.	</p>
<p><i>The Texas Connection with 
	the American Revolution</i> is of 
	interest to anyone wanting to know 
	more about Spain’s assistance in 
	the American colonies’ war of 
	independence. Wikipedia also provides 
	a good background biography 
	of Galvez who helped connect 
	Texas to the American Revolution.</p>

<p><i>This year America celebrated 
	the 40th anniversary of the

	after the landing.	</i></p>
<p>July 1969</p>
<p> Dear Circle, </p>
<p>Some of you may not believe 
	this, but last Sunday evening I saw 
	two guys walking and running 
	around on the moon!! It was and 
	still is hard for me to believe. 
	Whatever magic and romance was 
	associated with the moon was 
	knocked into a cocked hat when 
	Edwin Aldrin made that endaround- 
	cut by the Stars and 
	Stripes. Some show, and I doubt if 
	it will ever be topped! It has my 
	Oscar vote right now.	</p>
<p>So they left on Wednesday, 7- 
	16, landed on Moon Sunday, 7-20, 
	departed from Moon on Moonday, 
	7-21, and splashed down in Pacific 
	on Thursday, 7-24, for an 8 day 
	round trip that may never be 
	topped for adventure. It may be 
	weeks or months before all the 
	events of these last 8 days fully 
	sink in.	</p>
<p>So for a poor boy who was 
	born in 1910, in the rugged terrain 
	of Chariton County, Missouri, who 
	walked 1/2 mile to and from 
	school in all kinds of weather, who 
	saw the final era of the steam 
	engines and the horse, the 
	beginning of the radio, the 
	automobile, the tractor, television; 
	one who tried working his way 
	through the University in the 
	bottom of the Depression and 
	didn’t quite have what it took, who 
	has lived through 4 wars with 
	participation in one, who has seen 
	the developments of radar and the laser beam; who has seen medical 
	skill and technology advance to 
	restoring eye sight to one doomed 
	to blindness, transplanting of 
	virtually any organ except the 
	brain, who has seen the 
	development of aviation to where 
	jets can take you anywhere 
	between meals (all kinds of 
	transportation that takes us 
	anywhere with no thought of 
	trouble or breakdown), who has 
	seen the opening of the atomic age, 
	who has seen agriculture and 
	fertilizers developed to where 40 
	bu. corn yields ballooned to 100- 
	200 bu. yields; the zipper; instant 
	coffee, tea, soup, potatoes, breakfasts— 
	instant everything; and now 
	the space age with astronauts 
	bringing back rocks from the 
	Moon worth $40 billion.	</p>
<p>How can one generation be

<h3><a name="lost"></a>Meeting Long- 
	Lost Cousins</h3>
<h4> By Nina Harlan Kohl</h4>
<p><i> Editor’s Note: Harlan cousins 
	really enjoy comparing their 
	genealogical lines at our national 
	reunions, looking for the person 
	who most closely matches their 
	own. Recently, the Harlan Family 
	in America organization was 
	instrumental in connecting several 
	closely related Harlans who had 
	never met, as the following story 
	relates.	</i></p>
<p>It was wonderful to be reunited 
	with my long-lost cousins at this 
	summer’s Harlan-Miller Reunion! 
	My father remembered attending 
	family reunions when he was a 
	child living in Indiana, but he never 
	had an interest in genealogy, so I 
	was completely unaware that we 
	had such an interesting family 
	history. One day my father 
	mentioned that he thought there 
	were some Cherokee Harlans in 
	the family. I went online to check it 
	out, and, surfing around in 
	cyberspace, it wasn’t long before I 
	came upon my heretofore 
	unknown cousin, Esther “Essie” 
	Harlan Wells. She e-mailed me the 
	genealogy of our line going back 
	to the 1600s in England! [George 
	(3), Aaron (8), George (37), 
	George (180), Aaron (671), 
	George (2246), Marcellus (5711), 
	and offspring of George Newton 
	(5711-2)].</p>
<p> I was stunned. In a moment, I 
	went from knowing nothing about 
	my family beyond the names of 
	my great-grandparents, to knowing 
	centuries of family lineage. Such is 
	the miracle of the Internet! It 
	brought me the gift of Essie, who 
	opened up the world of genealogy 
	and a whole extended family I 
	didn’t know existed.	</p>
<p>I accepted Essie’s invitation 
	and came down from Wisconsin to 
	attend the reunion Sunday afternoon, 
	June 14, 2009, in Crawfordsville, 
	Indiana. It was wonderful to 
	meet folks I had been in touch with 
	via e-mail, and even to see a family 
	resemblance! I got to meet the 
	descendants of brothers and sisters 
	of my great-grandfather. I had seen 
	a photo of Diana Wells on the 
	Internet, but, in person, the resemblance 
	to my father’s side of the 
	family was even more striking, and I 
	was thrilled to meet Ray and Melba 
	Harlan King, and Ben Harlan and 
	his wife, Mary, and too many other 
	family members to mention. I can’t 
	wait to attend again next summer, 
	when Diana has promised me a 
	cemetery tour of Crawfordsville, 
	Indiana, to see all the places our 
	ancestors are buried. It will be the 
	89th annual reunion of this branch 
	of the Harlan family.</p>
<p> One of the most amazing things 
	about attending the reunion was 
	getting a chance to see photo albums 
	showing pictures of ancestors dating 
	back to the Civil War era. Members 
	of the Harlan family have 
	painstakingly recorded and carefully 
	preserved so much family history 
	and I am very grateful for that. Two 
	CDs were given out—one made 
	from a home movie filmed at the 
	1941 reunion, which included my 
	great-grandfather Charles Merle, 
	and another with many photos of 
	family members taken in recent 
	years.</p>
<p> I have gone from being 
	someone who saw herself as part of 
	a nuclear family, to someone who 
	sees herself as being part of 
	something much bigger—an 
	extended family of cousins around 
	the country. Now I am aware of 
	roots that go deeper than I knew, 
	and I am fascinated to follow the 
	personal story of our family through 
	America’s history. The best part of 
	all this is being able to share it with 
	my daughter, Cecilia Jane. I hope 
	that we will be attending many 
	Harlan reunions together in the 
	future!</p>

<h3><a name="enigma"></a>Judicial Enigma: The First Justice Harlan</h3>
<h4>By Tinsley E. Yarbrough 
	<br>
	Reviewed by Clinton F. Cross	</h4>
<p><i>Editor’s Note: The Fall 2008 
	Harlan Record included a review of 
	The Republic According to John 
	Marshall Harlan, a biography by 
	Linda Przybyszewski (Chapel Hill: 
	Univ. of N.C. Press, 1999) outlining 
	the ways that Harlan’s family, in her 
	opinion, influenced his judicial 
	outlook. Tinsley Yarbrough’s book, 
	reviewed below, takes another 
	perspective, arguing that the first 
	Justice Harlan’s judicial opinions 
	sometimes contradicted each other. 
	You may also find it interesting to 
	re-read the article about the first 
	Justice Harlan in the Spring 2004 
	Harlan Record. Old issues of the 
	Harlan Record are available at 
	www.harlanfamily.org.	</i></p>
<p>George Harlan’s seed produced 
	many distinguished progeny, but 
	perhaps none more distinguished 
	than John Marshall Harlan and his 
	grandson, both of whom served as 
	justices on the United States 
	Supreme Court. Professor Tinsley 
	Yarbrough, having already written a 
	biography of the second justice 
	Harlan, recently published a 
	biography of the first justice 
	Harlan. </p>
<p>Yarbrough focuses on the 
	contradictions in Harlan’s career 
	—his support of slavery, his 
	opposition to the Emancipation 
	Proclamation, his commitment to 
	the Republican Party (the party of 
	business), and his support for the 
	Spanish American War—all of 
	which seems at odds with his 
	famous dissents in the civil rights 
	cases, his reluctance to support 
	“substantive due process” 
	concepts that restricted the 
	government’s right to regulate 
	commerce (see his dissent in 
	<i>Lochner v. New York</i>), and his 
	support for the extension of 
	constitutional rights to the 
	inhabitants of America’s newly 
	acquired “colonies” after the 
	Spanish American War (see his 
	dissents in the<i> Insular Cases</i>).	</p>
<p>Linda Przybyszewski contends 
	in her book <i>The Republic 
	According to John Marshall 
	Harlan</i> that Justice Harlan consistently 
	followed his own perception 
	and understanding of his family’s 
	religious, and national values.	</p>
<p>Professor Yarbrough, on the 
	other hand, characterizes Harlan as 
	an “enigma.” He summarizes in 
	detail Harlan’s personal life, as 
	well as his political and judicial 
	career, and he highlights the 
	contradictions. He identifies the 
	apparent flaws in Harlan’s 
	character and apparent 
	inconsistencies in his political and 
	judicial opinions. </p>
<p>He attempts to explain 
	Harlan’s “evolving” views as a 
	result of his personal relationships 
	with other influential individuals 
	—his law partner, Benjamin 
	Bristow, who opposed slavery and 
	almost became President of the 
	United States; his daughter Edith, 
	who cared for the disadvantaged; 
	his sons, who usually supported 
	and sometimes contributed to his 
	opinions; Frederick Douglass, the 
	articulate former slave who 
	opposed slavery and segregation; 
	and by other significant events in 
	his life. He also speculates that 
	Harlan may have been influenced 
	by an awareness of his halfbrother 
	James, who was half-white 
	and half-black. </p>
<p>Yarbrough acknowledges that 
	Harlan helped inspire the modern 
	civil rights movement, and he 
	contends that this was Harlan’s 
	greatest legacy. The book is well 
	documented. In support of his 
	contention he quotes federal 
	district judge and former civil 
	right’s advocate Constance Baker 
	Motley, who remarked at 
	ceremonies in honor of Supreme 
	Court Justice Thurgood Marshall 
	that:	</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>“Marshall had a ‘Bible’ 
		(Harlan’s dissenting opinion in 
		<i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>) to which he 
		turned during his most depressed 
		moments….Marshall would read 
		aloud passages from Harlan’s 
		amazing dissent. I do not believe 
		we ever filed a major brief in the 
		pre-<i>Brown</i> (<i>Brown v. Board of 
			Education</i>) days in which a 
		portion of that (<i>Plessy</i>) opinion 
		was not quoted. Marshall’s 
		favorite quotation was, ‘Our 
		Constitution is color-blind.’…It 
		became our basic creed. Marshall 
		admired the courage of Harlan 
		more than any Justice who has 
		ever sat on the Supreme Court. 
		Even Chief Justice Earl Warren’s 
		forthright and moving decision for 
		the Court in <i>Brown</i> did not affect 
		Marshall in the same way. Earl 
		Warren was writing for a 
		unanimous Supreme Court. 
		Harlan was a solitary and lonely 
		figure writing for posterity.”	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Linda Przybyszewski’s and 
	Tinsley Yarbrough’s biographies 
	complement each other. I believe 
	they should be read in the order of 
	publication—Linda’s first, and 
	then Tinsley’s. After reading both 
	books, you decide: was Harlan a 
	family man, committed to his 
	Harlan family values; was he an 
	opportunist and an inconsistent 
	“enigma”; or perhaps a little of 
	both?</p>
<h2><a name="gcorner"></a>GENEALOGY CORNER: A Chance Meeting</h2>
<p>The Harlans and Hollingsworths continue to find connections that 
	span several generations. Back in April 2009 I received an e-mail from a
	 lady whose name is Susan Aggarwal who wanted to advise the Harlan 
	family of a recent event with the Hollingsworths. She said the Hollingsworths
	 had purchased a family quilt at an auction in Pennsylvania 
	with signatures of two Harlans’ and four Hollingsworths’ names. It 
	was supposedly purchased from a Hollingsworth family member in Baltimore.
	They were trying to do some 
	family research to identify the family Their plan was to donate this to
	an appropriate museum/venue.	</p>
<p>My response back to Susan about the possible connection of the Harlans and
	Hollingsworths was fun to 
	research. It didn’t take long by using the History and Genealogy of the Harlan
	Family book to discover the 
	links she mentioned. It appears that two brothers, William Amoss Harlan and
	Caleb Harlan, married sisters, Sarah 
	Benson and Pamelia Benson. William and Sarah married in 1832 in the Little
	Falls Meeting in Harford County, 
	Md., and Caleb and Pamelia married in 1837. Many of the names on the quilt
	are also listed as signers of each 
	marriage certificate.</p>
<p> The Harlan book states that William and Sarah moved to Michigan in 1853 along
	with their children. Caleb 
	and Pamelia moved to Noble County, Ohio, in 1841. I didn’t find any marriages
	to Hollingsworths so am not 
	sure how the two families were actually linked in this instance.</p>
<p> The book relates that “from the Baltimore Monthly Meeting records the information
	is gained that John 
	Harlan, father of William Amoss and Caleb, at the time of his marriage was
	residing in the city of Baltimore. The 
	eldest two children were born there, which indicates that it was there that
	they began housekeeping.”	</p>
<p>But back to the original question…the Harlans and Hollingsworths both settled
	in the Chester County, Pa., 
	area where they were considered respected and upstanding citizens. Personally
	I would like to see the quilt given 	to the Chester County, Pa., Historical
	Society since the Harlans have made a number of donations to them due to
	their long association in the area.</p>
<p>The Spring 2009 issue of the 
	Hollingsworth Heritage newsletter 
	shows a picture of the quilt and a 
	lengthy article is included.	</p>
<p>According to the article the quilt is 
	called a Baltimore Album quilt and 
	is considered rare because it is 
	usually a family quilt, possibly 
	made to give to someone for a 
	special occasion. All of the squares 
	are different and done by a variety 
	of people. 
	In the last conversation I had 
	with Susan, she told me that she 
	was going to contact the Chester 
	County Historical Society to see if 
	they have any quilts with a Hollingsworth 
	connection.	</p>

	and dates on the quilt:	</p>
