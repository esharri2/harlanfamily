<p><b>MADGE HARLIN BROWN, </b>born June 24, 1898 passed away October 27,

1998.&nbsp; She had looked forward to her 100th birthday for so long with

such anticipation.&nbsp; It seemed that following the event on June 24

that all of her goals had been reached.&nbsp; Madge was featured in an

of her life and "family" including all Harlins, Harlans, Harlens and Harlands.&nbsp;

Ellis was born in 1908 in a log cabin near Stuart, Iowa.&nbsp; He grew

up helping on his family farm, and graduated from Stuart High School in

1927.&nbsp; Ten years later he married Julia Blount and together they had

three children.&nbsp; Ellis worked at the Maytag Company in Newton, IA

<center><a name="JEHU"></a><b><font size=+1>JEHU M. HARLAN, CHAIR MAKER</font></b></center>



<p>Patricia L. Banks of Orem, UT provided the following story about her

Great Great Grandfather, Jehu M. Harlan (#6908, p. 937 Harlan Genealogy).&nbsp;

Jehu was born June 23, 1826 in Barren Co., KY.&nbsp; For sixty-five years

Uncle Jehu, as he was known, made a living as a chair maker despite the

increasing competition from furniture factories.&nbsp; His hospitality

and cordial manner was spicy and at 86 he seemed no older than he appeared

some ten or fifteen years before. He was as spry as a cricket. Uncle Jehu,

made split-bottom and cane bottom chairs following the trade he learned

as a boy in the dense forests of Kentucky. Hand made dining chairs and

parlor rockers were his specialities since he was old enough to turn a

lathe.&nbsp; He told of his life as follows:&nbsp; "I was born on a farm

in old Kentucky, and a might rough farm it was, too.&nbsp; My father was

a chair maker, and as was the custom in those days, I naturally took to

my father's vocation like a duck to water.&nbsp; Boys were not permitted

to select their own vocations.&nbsp; The matter rested with the father

and mother.&nbsp; I was such a good little chap that I've often wondered

why my parents did not train me to be a preacher.&nbsp; I guess they didn't

want me to starve to death.&nbsp; Anyhow, at an early age I became an apprentice

in my father's chair shop and bless me if I haven't been a'making chairs

ever since, and the funny thing about it is I never got tired of my job.&nbsp;

No, sir, I liked the business from the very start and the more chairs I

make the more I am anxious to make.&nbsp; I'm busy every day making chairs

and repairing old broken down chairs."&nbsp; The chairs that Jehu turned

out were substantial and well made.&nbsp; His reputation as a chair maker

spread beyond the local area.&nbsp; The Harlan make of chairs could be

found in Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky, Oregon, Illinois and Michigan.&nbsp;

He used maple and hickory timber in making the rounds, backs and posts

of split-bottom and cane-bottom chairs.&nbsp; White oak was used primarily

in making the bottoms for the chairs.&nbsp; Jehu said the demand for home

made chairs was not as great when he was 86 as in older days when he turned

out eight or ten chairs a day.&nbsp; At 86 his production was an average

of one chair a day. Jehu died September 9, 1913.

<p>David and Fannie Harlan celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary at

a family dinner and gathering.&nbsp; The Harlans were married September

2, 1930.&nbsp; Mr. Harlan worked for 43 years at AT&amp;T and Mrs. Harlan

retired from Troutmans, where she worked in the jewelry department for

20 years.&nbsp; The Harlans live in Eastbrook and have three children:&nbsp;

Jim of Phoenix, Norma Cathcart of Mercer, and Fred of New Castle.&nbsp;

<center><a name="tim"></a><b><font size=+1>TIM HARLAN, ARTIST AT THE GRILL</font></b></center>



<p>Ribs...gumbo...frog legs...boudin sausage with Cajun jam...these are

just some of the specialties that Tim Harlan of Columbia, Missouri, prepares

on the grill.&nbsp; He won the Soulard Cajun Creole Cook-Off in St. Louis

in 1993 with his recipe for gumbo.&nbsp; He was a winner again in 1996

and has finished near the top a number of other times.

<p>Some people assume Tim is from the South because of his style of cooking,

but he tells them, "It's south Main Street in Boonville, MO. That's my

Southern heritage."&nbsp; Tim's first cooking lessons came from his mother,

Dorothy Cochran Harlan, who insisted that boys need to be just as handy

in the kitchen as girls.&nbsp; During his college years at the University

of Missouri, he and his wife, Linda, found barbecuing on a grill was an

effective way to prepare meals economically.&nbsp; Tim is also the son

of the late Lane L. Harlan whose legal assistance was instrumental in establishing

the Harlan Family Association.

<p>For Tim, the kitchen is a place to relax from the pressures of a law

practice and serving in the Missouri General Assembly.&nbsp; He has been

Representative of a district in Columbia since 1994 and was the chief sponsor

of the managed care bill which is now law in Missouri.&nbsp; It is acknowledged

as the most comprehensive consumer managed care bill in the country.

<p>For fund raisers, Tim has prepared barbecued meat for a many as 300

people.&nbsp; Here is a version of one of Tim's favorites:

from George Harlan (#3) to his son Joshua.&nbsp; The transfer was made

to Joshua "in consideration of Fatherly love and affection."&nbsp; Now

Owned and operated as a Bed and Breakfast by Beverly McCausland, the house

features now include bedroom fireplaces, private baths, gardens, antiques,

canopy beds, an 1814 spring house and a sitting porch with rustic rockers.

<p>A study of the ownership of the house contradicts an earlier opinion

that this was Michael's (#4) residence.&nbsp; It is now believed that George

acquired the land in 1710, and the oldest section of the house, made of

logs, was built about 1715-1720.&nbsp; The middle section of the house

was added in 1835, and a much newer section has been attached to this part.&nbsp;

Harlans attending Celebration 300 in 1987 were able to tour the house and

fondly remember its&nbsp; charm as well as refreshments served by the residents'

children.

<p>Fifty-seven Harlans from Indiana and a few other states met on July

18, 1998 for a day of fun and fellowship.&nbsp; The group met at the Benedictine

Center in Beech Grove, IN.&nbsp; The full day program was planned by Gene

and Virginia Harlan, Brownsburg, Ray and Melba King, Marilyn and Charles

Spurgeon and Esther Wells, all of Indianapolis, Diane Wells of Atlanta,

IN, Carol and Glendon Griffith ,Lebanon, and Becky Hines, Hagerstown.

<p>Melba King welcomed the group followed by a video message from Dan Harlan,

President of the Harlan Family Association.&nbsp; Dan spoke of past family

get togethers and of future plans.&nbsp; Becky Hines and Gene Harlan talked

about genealogy and generation charts in "Do you Know Your Family?"&nbsp;

Gene stated that the singing and eating are always important at a reunion,

but finding new relationships -- names, dates and places is the "Big Time

Fun!"&nbsp; The group then took a welcome break with Becky Gaskill leading

the singing and with Ray King on the piano.

<p>The group was fortunate to hear a repeat of the program delivered at

Mt. Pleasant in 1997, titled "The Lincoln Connection" which focused on

the women in the Lincoln-Harlan History.&nbsp; Lynn Ellsworth from Iowa

Wesleyan College and Connie King of Bondville, VT presented the program.&nbsp;

After lunch, Ray King provided some video clips of the Mt. Pleasant reunion,

Gene Harlan spoke of tombstone Art Symbols and Diana wells made a presentation

of gravestone rubbings and etchings.&nbsp; The program concluded with the

singing of "A Family of Friends".

<p>The highlight of our time in England was our stop at St. Peter's Monkwearmouth.&nbsp;

They were celebrating the Festival of the Flowers and the church was beautifully

decorated including a bouquet in honor of the visiting Harlans.&nbsp; We

were joined at this stage of the tour by cousin Erasmus "Raz" Harland who

lives in the area.&nbsp; He entertained us with stories of his family as

we drove through the fog shrouded hills in search of Harland Moor.&nbsp;

Unfortunately we were not able to see the Moor but we did enjoy Raz's stories.&nbsp;

Other Highlights in England included Harewood House and gardens, the Bronte

parsonage at Haworth and the picturesque Cotswolds.

<p>We made several delightful stops in Wales including Caernarfon Castle

where Prince Charles was invested as Prince of Wales, Portmeirion, a quaint

Italinate style village, and a ride on a narrow gauge railroad to Blaenau

Ffestiniog an area where they mined slate.

<p>Traveling with our extended family is always an experience and with

Marge Sgroi's guidance we always have a good time.&nbsp; An interesting

note was that there were 12 of us who had been to both celebration 300

and 310 reunion, and on both tours to Great Britain.

ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT</font></b></center>



<p>The officers and board members of The Harlan Family in America met April

25, 1999, at the home of Secretary Ruth Harlan Lamb in Independence, Missouri.

It was the desire of Dan Harlan, coordinator of the 1987 national family

reunion in Delaware and current president of the association, to step down

as leader but to remain as a member of the Board of Directors. All members

of The Harlan Family in America are indebted to Dan for his vision and

dedication and for making us more aware of our Harlan heritage. Former

Vice-President Bob Harlan of Yuba City, CA, will now serve as president.

Bob is the narrator of the 1997 reunion videotapes and was master of ceremonies

at the closing program in Mt. Pleasant, IA.

<p>Other business conducted at the board meeting included voting to expand

the total number of board members from 8 to 11, and Robert A. Harlan (PA),

Liz Sly (NJ), and C.J. King (VT) have accepted the positions.

<p>The group reviewed advice from attorneys for setting up a tax-exempt

foundation but at the present, our organization doesn't qualify under IRS

requirements unless several changes were to be made. The study of tax-exempt

status will continue.

<p>Martha and Elgene Smith have been asked to serve as historians of the

Harlan Family, and they have accepted the position. The Smiths live in

Chadds Ford, PA, and are remembered for their work in helping make the

1987 gathering such a success.

<p>Entries in the Harlan logo contest were reviewed, and the Board voted

to revise the original Celebration 300 logo to better fit the ongoing organization.

<p>It is the wish of the board to publish The Harlan Record two times a

year--around October 1 and April 1. The editors for the last 13 years,

Tom and Marylee Harlan, have decided to step down as editors after this

edition, and it was with deep regret that the Board accepted their decision.

The October 1, 1999,&nbsp; issue will be prepared by Ruth Harlan Lamb with

a permanent editor to be named later.

<p>Plans are to investigate the feasibility of obtaining a copyright of

Alpheus Harlan's History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family and a trademark

for the Harlan logo. Harlan's "Stitchery by Sue", owned by Jim and Sue

Harlan of AZ, was recognized as the official source of Harlan clothing

and memorabilia items.

<p>The Board set the year 2002 for the next national Harlan Family Reunion.

Possible sites will soon be explored.

<center><a name="SPRING HILL"></a><b><font size=+1>HARLAN HOMECOMING BRINGS

SPRING HILL TO LIFE</font></b></center>



<p>The coming home of the Harlans to Spring Hill was a weekend of Brigadoon,

as George Harlan's (#45) old house came to life with his descendents presence.

The historic event will surely mark forever Memorial Day weekend, 1998,

in West Virginia.

<p>The first Harlans to arrive on the farm parked in the barnyard and went

immediately--to the barn. The great doors were opened and left so, as if

to say "Welcome;" the hayloft, granary, stalls and foundations were all

explored.

<p>Spring Hill had been through a renovation and clean-up. It no longer

is exactly the original house, but the modern changes do not alter its

essential character. When the far-flung Harlans entered the oldest room,

they saw a refurbished log cabin with a 9 X 5 foot stone fireplace. This

had been the kitchen, of course, but now it is a den.

<p>The main house has had two major alterations to accommodate the modern

age: central heating, and the installation of a bathroom.&nbsp; The family

was fortunate to have discovered several wonderful furnishings stored in

the attic at Overlook, a larger and later house.&nbsp;&nbsp; These were

displayed and included some family Limoges china and German doll dishes,

a rare 1838 coverlet over the old Harlan rocker, and selected&nbsp; pictures.&nbsp;

The Harlan Bible was left open to the births/marriages pages with the oldest

entry being of Jehu Harlan's (#831) birth in 1788. (This&nbsp; particular

Bible was George Boyd Harlan's (#2878); Jehu was his father.)

<p>Upstairs, the hall contained family pictures and an beautiful pitcher

and bowl set.&nbsp; The smaller bedroom had a family quilt on the wall

opposite an old round-top trunk set alongside some fabulous examples of

turn-of-the-century clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main bedroom was the very

room in which six Harlan sisters (daughters of George Boyd, parents and

grandparents of current Harlan cousins) grew up together. Here a trunk

was opened to show some white slips and skirts.&nbsp; Near them hung a

wonderful Gibson Girl blouses and wraps and threw across the bed an intricately

made velvet cape.

<p>There were many outdoor activities for visitors, including a horse-drawn

ride (a pair of Percherons, no less) out into the high grass pasture. Another

event was the search with metal detectors for Civil War (or other) artifacts

in the soil.&nbsp; All ages of people were digging for what the troops

might have left.&nbsp; However, after a couple of hours, only one person

found a bullet.

<p>Susan Crites, a local history buff and professional story teller, riveted

her audience with "Ghosts Along the Potomac: Ghosts that Haunt the Hedgesville

Area." Later Saturday night several Harlans visited Susan's pub in Martinsburg

where costumed Civil War reenactors interacted with them.

<p>Sunday morning, many people&nbsp; attended church, especially Falling

Waters Presbyterian Church, the Harlans' own church for seven generations.

All of George Harlan's descendants who remained on the farm are buried

there. (George himself with his wife and parents [James #11] are thought

to be buried in Providence Quaker Cemetery on the other side of Martinsburg.)

<p>Sunday afternoon there was an enormous event for everyone, including

several hundred local neighbors and friends of the Harlans; an outdoor

music concert featuring local artists playing popular music, bluegrass

and jazz. As a special feature of this program, the president and several

other administrators of nearby Shepherd College presented our aunt, Douglass

Harlan, a recognition of her career and contribution to Berkeley County.

As a renowned former public school teacher she is known to a wide range

of people. She is also the last of the surnamed Harlans from our branch.

<p>The real weekend happening was the interactions of people--cousins finding

each other, Harlans learning about their past and themselves, and a real

combined sharing of this historic occasion.

<p>At the outset I suggested this so-called homecoming was not about numbers

or dates as much as about a place.&nbsp; We did register well over 100,

and many others came by and spent time with us and, unless they signed

the guest book, left no record.&nbsp; The idea for the McMurrays was to

introduce Spring Hill to Harlans who care about the family. We have done

that. I expect we will have Harlan tourists from time to time from now

on, which is as it should be. (But please let us know in advance of your

planned visit.)

<p>As you will see in the Financial Report, our current funds available

are getting quite low.&nbsp; This is due primarily to the fact that we

reprinted the Harlan Genealogy book and must pay in advance of sales.&nbsp;

We will recoup that money over time as the book sells, but meanwhile, we

are cash poor.&nbsp; We do not charge a membership or subscription fee

for the Harlan Record.&nbsp; So we are now calling on you to voluntarily

make a contribution to the Harlan Family in America.&nbsp; You may make

a general contribution or a contribution to the Remembrance Fund in honor

of a special Harlan.&nbsp; Please send your contributions to John Harlan,

Treasurer, 422 Aumond Rd, Augusta, GA 30909.
