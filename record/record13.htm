</h3>

<p>As a result of discussions held during the Mt. Pleasant Reunion between Tom 

  and Marylee Harlan, Jon Harlan and Larry Harlan, a Home Page for the Harlan 

  Family of America was up and running on the Internet as of October 1,1997. It 

  contains a wealth of information pertinent to the Harlan/Harland families including 

  our Officers, The Record ( the electronic version), our history, reunion reports 

  and notices, electronic addresses of cousins, messages, other web site links, 

  and a Harlan store offering reunion memorabilia and the Genealogy Book.Jon Harlan 

  who operates an Internet company, Aeneas, agreed to be our Host and established 

  the Site for us at no charge. Thank you, Jon! Pam Ellingson, the Site Manager, 

  has many tricks up her sleeve and one of them is a system to keep track of the 

  number of "visits" to each of our pages and we are happy to say that over 1300 

  visits to the Harlan Page have been made thus far. </p>

<p>If you don't own a computer, ask a friend or visit the library and surf to 

  the Harlan Site. You'll be surprised at what you see. Now you'll have a real 

  excuse to buy a computer if you don't already own one. Our address is http://www.harlanfamily.org

        <tr> 

          <td width="50%">By the time you read this, the Harlan Family Board of 

            Directors will have held its first meeting since the July 1997 Reunion 

            in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. We joined a get-together of Arizona Harlans 

            in Phoenix on February 28. The Board met the night before. There are 

            such exciting things in progress, that the Board will be an "active" 

            coordinating body. How this should work out was a major part of our 

            discussion. Some of the items on the agenda included: 

            <ol>

              <li> A concentrated effort over the next two or more years to reach 

                many more Harlans across the country -- to connect them to the 

                "organized" part of the family and acquaint them with the Harlan 

                Web-site -- which by the way is outstanding. 

              <li>An update and orientation on the workings of the web site, including 

                how the Board should relate to it. 

              <li> Adoption of a "mission" statement such as Ridge Harlan has 

                proposed.

                concerning where and when to hold the next national Reunion. Though 

                some of you may demur, I want to recommend that there be a moratorium 

                on this matter (as important as it is) for at least the next two

              <p>All of us as Harlans are a part of what I consider a unique Family 

                experience. As a museum docent in New Castle, DE once told me, 

                the early Harlans of the area "were not numerous, but they were 

                prestigious." With the understanding the "prestige" means honor 

                and influence, I hope our Family is still a "prestigious" one!<br>

<p>Cynthia Ressler draws our attention to a new book titled "The Ohio Frontier, 

  Crucible of the Old Northwest, 1720-1830" by R. Douglas Hurt. Mr. Hurt is a 

  Professor in Agricultural History and Rural Studies at Iowa State University. 

  According to Cynthia, for those of you interested in an area where the Harlans 

  once lived, this book makes for very interesting reading. The areas of social, 

  economic and military developments in this region are quite fascinating. The 

  book provides a wonderful collage of understanding the settlement of land cut 

  out of the Northwest Territory. The special treat is the mention of our George 

  #180 on p. 299. The book was published in 1996 by Indiana University Press.

<p>Madge Harlin Brown will turn 100 this summer. Although she doesn't get around 

  much any more, in her life she has traveled all over the world, including countries 

  in Europe, Africa, the Middle and Far East. She credits her longevity to this 

  travel that made life more interesting for her. Even when not traveling she 

  lived an interesting life. Madge likes to do for others and over the years she 

  has made probably -hundreds of angel food cakes which she gave away. She also 

  estimates that she has made over a thousand crochet covered hangers and other 

  crocheted and needlepoint items. </p>

<p>Madge's little brother, Hugh keeps busy too. He built a scale model of the 

  Harlin house in which he was born in 1912. The model is displayed in the lobby 

  of the Century Bank of the Ozarks. (See article in Harlan Record No. 9, Winter 

  1995, for more information on the bank). Be sure to stop in when passing through 

  Gainesville, MO. He has also documented his life and family history in an interesting 

  book titled the Harlins of Ozark County. <a href="#up"><img src="../images/up.gif" align = RIGHT width="35" height="35"></a></p>

</h3>

<p>All across America the descendants of George and Michael (and Thomas) Harlan 

  migrated, settled and became solid citizens wherever they located. The first 

  few generations in America were average farmers for the most part though George 

  served as a governor in the Delaware region at one time. Succeeding generations 

  of Harlans went on to become merchants, soldiers, lawyers, congressmen, justices, 

  doctors, teachers, and homemakers, plus workers in many other occupations. We 

  know about George, Michael and Thomas.....James Harlan.....John Marshall Harlan.....but 

  there are other notable Harlan descendant stories out there! </p>

<p>We need your help in sharing these chronicles with other Harlans both on the 

  internet and through the Record. Suggested criteria for articles for "Who's 

  Who in Harlans" should: <br>

</p>

<p>

  

<li>feature notable events, careers or contributions in the lives of Harlan kin, 

<li>or contain human interest stories concerning Harlan kin, 

<li>and have universal appeal for readers. 

<li> 

  <p>If possible tell how the person descends from George, Michael or Thomas.</p>

  <p>If you have an interesting story about a Harlan descendant or a Harlan contemporary, 

    please send it to Ruth Harlan Lamb whose e-mail address is: harlamb@aol.com.

    <p><strong>HARLAN FAMILY LETTERS</strong> </p>

    <p>The family of Benjamin Harlan (#873) would probably be astounded to know 

      that the letters they wrote to one another over the years from 1830 to 1880 

      would be read with interest by their descendants and other relations. Louis 

      and Sadie Harlan and Harriet Sheddan Harlan read this collection of letters, 

      transcribed them to facilitate reading by others, and worked to complete 

      the documentation of Benjamin's descendants beyond what Alpheus had in 1914. 

      Louis has written an introduction to the collection as well as a short history 

      of the family. These materials help the reader to understand the times in 

      which the letters were written and the family relationships of the writers. 

      According to Louis, "The letters are restricted to news of the family, including 

      uncles, aunts, and cousins, and about farmhands, news and gossip about neighbors 

      and friends, and notices of changing crop prices and crop yields, but within 

      these limits they open up a vista of a lost rural world that is alien to 

      our twentieth-century experience." "The reader of these letters gains more 

      than a glimpse of college undergraduate life in the first years after the 

      Civil War, as colleges and universities all over the south that had closed 

      because of the war and for lack of students began to open again. It was 

      certainly because of the insistence of Benjamin's wife, Sarah Ann Harlan 

      (2960), that first Benjamin Joseph Harlan (3096) and later his elder brother 

      George Henry (3095) and younger brother John Caldwell, know as Cullie (3097) 

      were sent off to college to 'improve themselves,' overriding their father's 

      need for their labor on the farm." The letter included here was written 

      by Benjamin Joseph Harlan to his mother Sarah while he as away as school. 

      Current Harlans with children away at school will certainly get a chuckle 

      from this. </p>

  <i>Lexington (KY) May 4th '66<br>

  Dear Mother,<br>

  I received your most welcome letter this evening. I hasten to reply, for I have 

  some things of considerable interest to me to write about, and I trust they 

  will be so to you. In the first place I am very glad to learn that your health 

  is so much better. I have been sick since I last wrote. I was compelled to miss 

  two days & a half from school. I think that I am nearly as well as ever. I was 

  very much delighted today to learn that Cousin Sarah Jane Arnold (3076) was 

  in the city. I went down to see her, she has just come over from Danville, and 

  she told me a good deal of news. she said that all of our relations were in 

  good health. She said that Uncle James (845) had heard from his son, Jim (2968) 

  a few days ago & he sent him, that is, his father, a check for a hundred dollars. 

  She also said that here Brother Ben (3078) was dead. I would like to have your 

  advice on the following subject. Sometimes when they have a special call for 

  money at the church I sometimes throw in something. And last week there was 

  a laddy here on a mission for the starving women and children of the south, 

  and I couldn't keep from giving something. I don't know whether it was right 

  or not. I know that it all comes from Pa, but I won't give anything more until 

  I hear from you. I will now give you the state of my finances. I have got just 

  seventy five cents and I owe that to the society. All the Members have to pay 

  that sum every three months. I have used the money that you sent me to the best 

  advantage that I knew how, if you think that I have been extravagant, I will 

  give a satisfactory explanation when I come home. 

  <p>In the purchase of some things I know now that I did not act as judiciously 

    as I should have done, but as I said before I did the best that I knew how 

    to do. I spent the last money that I had for a pair (of) panloons, they are 

    the firs(t) pair that I have bought since I left home, if you recollect how 

    limited my stock was I know that you will think I needed them. </p>

  </i> <i> 

  <p>I have not bought any hat, my old black one is very rusty and has one hole 

    in it. The season has not yet arrived for my straw, and it is very much discolored. 

  </p>

  </i> <i> 

  <p>I will now give you as plain a statement as I can of what I will need. A 

    hat, a vest and enough money to pay for two months washing, to come home on 

    and to pay the balance of my board. I would like for you to send me two or 

    three pairs of cotton socks, when you send the shirts for which I am much 

    obliged to you. Cousin Sarah Jane sends her love to you and Pa. Hoping to 

    hear from your soon. <br>

    I remain Your Affectionate Son,<br>

  </p>

  <p>--- Benj. J. Harlan<i>P.S. Dr. Gibney has not hinted a word about his board 

    but I tthought probably he was begin(n)ing to think that it was time I was 

    begin(n)ing to pay up. I (s)uppose that it is unnecessary for me to say anything 

    about my own wants. You need not bother yourself sending any for me. I will 

    try to get along without the things that I need. I try ­not to mind as much 

    as I used to the opinion of the world, but I like to & I think it is my duty 

    to make a respectable appearance. <br>

      <strong>A VISIT TO TOMPKINSVILLE, KENTUCKY</strong> 

    </center>

  </h3>

  <p> Early in our family history searches, my wife Marjorie and I visited Tompkinsville 

    to see if we could find any Harlan history. We had heard about The Old Mulkey 

    Meeting House, but did not know if we could find any Harlans in Tomkinsville. 

    We stopped at the Court House and asked if they knew of any Harlans living 

    in town. 

  <p>We were directed to uncle Jim Harlan's house where we visited for some time 

    with Uncle Jim and his wife, both of them 90 at the time. We were not able 

    to identify a connection with our family, but we had a nice visit with them 

    and at the Harlan Library next door. </p>

  <p>Uncle Jim told us that their only son died and left them the proceeds of 

    a life insurance policy. At that time they owned the land where the library 

    is now located. After their son's death they told the city fathers they would 

    give them the money from the insurance and donate the land if the city would 

    build a library and dedicate it to their son. The library was built, and now 

    houses a fine collection of genealogy materials in addition to general library 

    items. 

  <p>My wife and I have been back to use the family history material. I found 

    quite a lot of material on the Hammer and Yocum families; both are in my family 

    line. Jacob Harlan #800 emigrated from near Tompkinsville to Illinois in 1834. 

  <p>Old Mulkey House is now a state historic site, and is the site where Squire 

    Boone (father of Daniel Boone, and Hannah Boone Stewart Pennington) are buried. 

    Hannah Boone was an ancestor of mine through the Pennington family. About 

    every two years the site has some special event to celebrate its founding 

    in 1797. In 1994 they held an Old Time Camp Meeting, and in 1996 The Old Mulkey 

    Homecoming program included "the Life of Hannah Boone." The Meetinghouse is 

    located at 1819 Old Mulkey road, Tompkin-sville, Kentucky. ----<i>James Rogers

      <strong>THE SENATOR'S VIEW OF THE REUNION</strong> 

    </center>

  </h3>

  <p> This morning, as I do every morning, I looked down from my home on high 

    at my old town of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. It was a cool, windy, rainy day - not 

    the usual weather for this time of year. As I watched, my gaze drew me to 

    the old cemetery where my wife and I and some of our children lie. It was 

    just a little past eleven and all of a sudden the rain stopped. The grave 

    stone had been freshly cleared and the grass had been recently mowed. Sure 

    looked nice. At the same time, I saw a number of strange vehicles coming in 

    the main gate of the cemetery and they seemed to be heading for our grave 

    site. They all stopped and got out of their vehicles and gathered around. 

    There were at least 50 people there - maybe more. Then, two people came thru 

    the crowd and placed a floral wreath and American Flags at our graves. This 

    man said some nice things about me - some of them were even true. This person 

    said he and his wife were born and raised in Greencastle, Indiana. They seemed 

    to know that was where I got my education at Old Asbury College. That was 

    way back in 1846. They call it DePauw university now. 

  <p>As I watched the crowd, I decided they were mostly Republicans - you know, 

    you can tell by looking. If I could have been there, I sure would have made 

    a speech and give them old Democrats a tongue lashing. They used to give me 

    a hard time and said bad things about me. Somebody said there were 523 Harlan 

    family members in town for the weekend. Five hundred and twenty-three is a 

    lot of anything - but all Harlan's - I don't believe it! But I'm sure this 

    has been an interesting day for the family. </p>

  <p>During my days as a teacher, preacher, politician, diplomat, I was considered 

    rather straight laced. I was never quoted for my humor. But, let me tell you 

    all something - as I looked down today, I smiled. ----<i>Senator James Harlan</i>

      and Kirks. 

    <li> After returning home from the 1994 family tour to England, cousin Phyllis 

      Harland wrote to Rev. Gareth Lloyd at Monkwearmouth to ask who baptized 

      George. His reply was a follows: Rd. (Richard?) Hicks, A.M. (Masters Degree?) 

      called a Priest, was the Perpetual Curate from 1638-1662 at the Monastery 

      built in 674 by Benedict Biscop. - Curate is a word peculiar to the Church 

      of England & the R.C. Church in Ireland. Such men were assistants to parish 

      priests. Today they are called Vicars. 

    <li> From the web site we gleaned the following information about Dinah Dixon 

      thanks to George and Milllie Dixon. Henry Dixon, b1630 in Armaugh Co., Ireland, 

      married Rose Harland c.1655 in Ireland. The three children of Henry and 

      Rose were William, born 1662; Dinah, born 1669; and Rose, born 1670. William 

      emigrated to New Castle, DE, and married Ann Gregg. Dinah married Michael 

      Harlan about 1690 in PA. (Rose, according to Alpheus married Thomas Pierson, 

      widower, and deputy surveyor of New Castle County.) </li>

    <li> Greetings from the Okanagan Valley. John H Harland-- Kelowna B C, (jharland@smartt.com) 

      I have always been of the opinion that 'Harland' was the quintessential 

      North-East England name. Admittedly my own family stem from Northern Ireland, 

      where the name, although well-known, is not very common. But even there, 

      it has to be an import from England, with the obvious example of the arrival 

      in Lurgan of George, Michael and their brother who remained in Ireland ... 

      (late 1600s). However, I recently found, very much to my surprise, that 

      the name occurs in Germany and Austria ....which likely explains why, when 

      I used to travel there, I was so often asked if I had German family roots. 

      It also raises the question as to whether a significant number of the Harland 

      connection in America today, stem from Continental Europe, rather than the 

      UK, as I had always supposed. It seems too prevalent a Germanic name to 

      postulate that they are descended from immigrants from England. On the other 

      hand, there can be little doubt about the ancestry of those Americans who 

      spell the name without the terminal 'd' .....in my opinion, they can only 

      be of English stock, being descendants of George and Michael. </li>

      <strong>INDIANA HARLANS TO GATHER</strong> 

    </center>

    Indiana Harlans and a few out of state kinfolk will meet Saturday, July 18, 

    1998 at the Beech Grove Benedictine Center in southeast Indianapolis. This 

    event is being planned as an educational and entertaining one-day affair geared 

    to all Harlans who would like to know more about Harlan history and meet others 

    who carry the same name. A program of speakers and workshops is being planned. 

    A video review of the 310th Harlan Reunion held last summer in Mt. Pleasant, 

    Iowa will be shown. Those attending will be encouraged to bring family genealogy 

    charts to share with others. Registration for adults will be $15 per person 

    including lunch (less for children). A mailing will be out to Indiana Harlans 

    in February. Other interested in attending should contact Ray and Melba Harlan 

    King, 3519 West Ellyn Drive, Indianapolis, IN 46208 (317-297-7997) or Ginny 

    and Gene Harlan, 385 Vinewood Dr. So., Brownsburg, IN 46112 (317-858-6303).

    <strong>HARLAN HOMECOMING</strong> 

  </center>

  More than 200 Harlans have expressed interest in attending Harlan Homecoming 

  on Memorial Day Weekend, 1998. The event is an opportunity to visit the original 

  homestead, Spring Hill, built by George Harlan (#45) after he, his brothers 

  and their families migrated down from Pennsylvania with their father, James 

  #11, in the 1730s-40s into what is now Eastern West Virginia. Together the brothers 

  claimed over 1,000 acres. The deed to the farm was finally granted from Thomas, 

  Lord Fairfax, in 1760. It is perhaps the only Harlan land remaining in the country 

  that has never left the family. 

  <p>Coming home to George #45's farm: All Harlan descendants in the United States 

    are invited to return for a visit to one of the oldest Harlan estates next 

    Memorial Day weekend, May 1998. Your visit will be welcomed not only by your 

    local relatives, but also by most of the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. 

    Already we have gotten involved the principle local cultural institution, 

    Shepherd College in Shepherdstown. We hope they will bring some of the program 

    in store for you. Several Harlans, including my mother and her sister, Douglass 

    Harlan, were alumnae of Shepherd. My aunt, whom we affectionately call "Dougie," 

    is the last surnamed Harlan in the area, and for her we also are calling this 

    reunion. We will connect her life with your visit by inviting all her former 

    students from her 40-year career to collect from us a membership card in "Miss 

    Douglass Harlan's Third Grade Alumnae/i" club. During the weekend we will 

    recognize them appropriately. 

  <p>Other entertainment will include Civil War reenactment, a limited search 

    right on the land for Civil War artifacts, visits to nearby Antietam Battlefield, 

    buggy rides to show you the entire farm, and an adjacent West Virginia Wine 

    and Music Festival. 

  <p>One of the most important events has just happened. We have granted the easement 

    rights of over 70 acres of the most historic land to conservancy. This includes 

    Harlan Spring, Spring Hill, "Auntie's House", the water cress ponds---in effect, 

    the whole watershed of the spring. As the spring was attractive to James #11 

    and his son George #45 and their family, so it is today to developers. The 

    protection now held in conservancy by The Land Trust of the Eastern Panhandle 

    will block any development. We strongly feel that raising the consciousness 

    of and enlisting the support of local citizens for the preservation of their 

    history and natural habitats will be an additional protection of the Harlan 

    property. And your visit to a Harlan homecoming will make that impression 

    more emphatic. 

  <p>The Home, Spring Hill: As the name implies, the house is on a hill above 

    a spring---Harlan Spring. It seems obvious that they laid claim to this spot 

    largely due to the value of the spring. In the beginning, the Harlan family 

    owned well over 1,000 acres. The present farm is about 250 acres. A project 

    this summer was to clear that hillside of growth so that we have restored 

    the old view of the spring from the house. That sight/site is magnificent 

    to behold. We hope that while you visit you might have the pleasure of witnessing 

    the circling and landing of a flock of Canada Geese on that pond. A whole 

    family of them hatched in the pasture spring before last, so they are also 

    "Harlans"! 

  <p>This summer was also spent in renovation of the oldest part of the house. 

    The original room is a log room with a 5' X 9' fireplace. To it was added 

    a stone room with 20" walls. On the other side, at some later date, was built 

    what is now the main house-a two story log and lathe building with a full 

    attic. Then, in later years, a small brick room was added. (We have never 

    known the precise year of any of the building.) The whole house, except for 

    the stone room, is parged, which I have learned from fascinating observation 

    of the contractors' working, is a coating of cement about an inch thick. The 

    cement during my lifetime was always painted white. But some with a longer 

    memory have commented that it once was off-white. We have just painted it 

    cream to match the yellow in some of the stones, and the repointing of the 

    chimney. The parging, as you can imagine, completely covers the construction 

    elements, so that you cannot guess from looking on the outside that one room 

    is log, another brick, etc. 

  <p>The interior of the house has not, to date, been altered except for installing 

    the modern conveniences of baseboard oil heat (which closed up the fireplaces!) 

    and a bathroom in the main hall under the staircase (which, alas, has ruined 

    the exposure of the suspension of the stairs all the way to the attic). These 

    compromises were done to enable someone to live with some comfort in the house, 

    which is the best security the house can have. 

  <p>Everyone is Welcome: The general invitation mailed in 1996 did not reach 

    everyone, of course. We have had to count on the word spreading, and are very 

    grateful for the chance to get the news out via the website and The Harlan 

    Record. In the meantime it has been really inspiring to find Harlans dropping 

    by unexpectedly, we hope in anticipation of their coming in May, but we have 

    been frustrated by their not always leaving their names so we can get back 

    to them. We have also found that some who have come (but not found us home) 

    were under the impression they were not invited! Nothing could be further 

    from the truth. If you didn't hear from us, we didn't find you. Please pass 

    the word along. And if you do drop by, knock on the door or leave a note in 

    the mail slot. Someone might be there! I make my living by moving around a 

    lot between clients, but I would love to know you're near or coming. My number 

    is in the phone book. 

  <p>There are still copies of the much-acclaimed book, The Harlans of Spring 

    Hill, by Douglass Harlan. This illustrated history of George #45's direct 

    ancestors who never left the property, is the single best background reading 

    for the visit. The price is just $7 with an additional $3 for mailing. Please 

    include with your request for copies the amount required with the check made 

    out to Harlan Homecoming, and mailed to the address below. 

  <p>The location, just north of Martinsburg, West Virginia, is in the orbit of 

    Washington, DC, and on the near side of Dulles Airport. For other details 

    about traveling and booking, please respond through the brochure we sent in 

    1996, or write for information to Harlan Homecoming, P.O. Box 9198, Richmond, 

    VA 23227-0198. (E-mail: harlanhome@aol.com) 

  <p>Two months ago we mailed information about accommodations in the area for 

    those wanting to book early. Memorial Weekend is also a graduation date, and 

    there will be some competition for space in motels, however, in early November 

    there was not yet a problem. 

  <p>The final registration fee is close to being determined as we price caterers 

    and other vendors. It is not too late to sign on. The latest news we can get 

    to you from now on will probably be on the website (harlanfamily.org). You 

    may also inquire at our e-mail, HARLANHOME@aol.com, or my own e-mail, nancyowa@earthlink.net.<br>
