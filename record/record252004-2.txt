Scrapbook Is Full of Harlan History

A California resident, Marjorie Ingram, recently received her great-great-great-grandfather’s scrapbook which contains many original letters, family records, and newspaper articles. They give an invaluable look at Missouri, Indiana and the Dakotas in the 1800s, as well as revealing the political climate of the time.

Judge Andrew Jackson Harlan (#1761) was born in Hamilton County, Ohio, in 1815 and at the age of 21, he left for Indiana. In 1838, he married Delilah Hendrix, and they had a daughter and son. In 1861 the family settled on a claim in the Dakota Territory, but according to Marjorie, they were chased out of the area by Indians and lost everything. They later lived in Wakeeny, Kans., and Savannah, Mo., where they are buried.

According to Alpheus Harlan’s genealogy book, Judge Harlan represented the Marion (Indiana) District for two years in the Lower House of Congress, and later served a term in Missouri’s General Assembly. He was also a member of the Constitutional Convention of the Territory of Dakota, a judge, and spent four years as a postmaster in Wakeeny.

After receiving the scrapbook items, Marjorie searched the Internet and located the Harlan Web site. She was surprised that a newer version of The Harlan Record was being published. She descends from Adelia (#4902) daughter of Judge Harlan.

Record Keeping by Quakers Proves to Be Invaluable

Information from“Shaking Your Family Tree”, a column by Myra Vanderpool Gormley

As early as 1675, a system of record keeping for Quakers was devised by George Fox, founder of the Society of Friends. These records were meticulous and extensive, providing genealogists invaluable tools for researching their roots.

Friends “meeting” records often contain characteristics and a language of their own, so it takes some study to be able to use them. Special research procedures are needed.

The book, Our Quaker Ancestors: Finding Them in Quaker Records, by Ellen Thomas Berry and David Allen Berry, gives some background and history of the American Quakers, including patterns of migration, the contents of monthly meeting records and how to locate and search them. Tips on finding and using Monthly 
Meeting Records are covered, and a chapter is devoted to the various Quaker repositories. It aids in searches for both birthright members of the Friends Society and for those who became members through "convincement” or marriage.

For those wanting to follow Quaker ancestors into the Midwest, it is necessary to become familiar with certain migration patterns. A large southward movement began in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, going through the Monocacy region of Maryland around 1725, and crossing the Potomac into Frederick County, Va., in 1732. Another migration went from Maryland into North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.

Other resources include:

• Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy, by William Wade Hinshaw and available in many libraries;

• New England Historical and Genealogical Pennsylvania, a collection of information from records of various Friends meetings;

• Unpublished Quaker records, located in the Friends Historical Library at Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa.;

• Other reference books and records in public libraries.


Tree Dedication Honors Harlan Ancestors
[]

The Florida State Society Daughters of the American Revolution had a dedication to the Millennium Forest, honoring their Patriot Ancestors by planting a long leaf pine at Hillsborough River State Park.

A seedling pine was planted for Aaron Harlan, Sr., and Aaron Harlan, Jr., who were in the Revolutionary War. 

Pictured at the dedication were (L to R): Orrin and Freddie Wright of Bartow, Fla., Sara Jo Reynolds of Plant City, Fla., and Barbara and Mike Fite, Fla.

(Editor’s Note: The Wrights had their power off for over a week as a result of Hurricane Charlie. Do we have any other Harlan cousins who would like to share news from these storms?) 


Colonial Dames Membership Made Possible by George

Mary Ann Hastings Estep, who lives in Muncie, agreed to organize a new chapter of Colonial Dames XVII Century in Delaware County, Ind. As organizing president, she had to submit three names for the new chapter: “George Harlan,” “Valentine Hollingsworth” and “Brandywine Creek,” names from the early days of Harlans in America.

Mary Ann’s second choice, “Valentine Hollingsworth” was selected by the national organization for the name of Chapter IN-15. Her membership was proven through George Harlan.

She also serves as Regent of Paul Revere Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, and is currently the Registrar of the de la Warr Chapter of the Daughters of the American Colonists. Proven ancestors for both organizations include early Harlans.

Mary Ann’s Harlan lineage is George #3, Aaron #8, Aaron #41, Aaron #194, Samuel #703, Stephen #2327, Joshua #5919, Arthur Brooks, Leoaldin Franklin and Mary Louise Harlan Hastings. 


J. F. Harlan’s Unusual Professions 

Editor’s Note: The following is a compilation of information from two biographical sketches written by John B. Harlan, subject of the story titled “John Bailey Harlan Was Shrewd Detective” on page 8 of the Spring 2004 Harlan Record. Juanita Creighton, of Richmond, Va., submitted the detective piece and the two sketches complied here. John B. Harlan was the brother of her grandfather, Howard Hinton Harlan (7956iii).

One of our Harlan cousins, James Forbes Harlan (#7956i), had some unusual professions. His brother, L&N Railroad detective John B. Harlan (#7956v), provided the following information. 

Born in Albemarle County, Va., on July 12, 1851, James moved with his family shortly after the Civil War to Mountain Grove, Bath County, Va., where they resided in a cabin on property owned by Colonel A.C.L. Gatewood, of Confederate fame. The farm was situated at the fork of Little Back Creek and Big Back Creek. 

“Mountain Grove was a little scattering village consisting of a Post Office, Blacksmith and Wheelwright shop, and a Manufacturing Mill belonging to old Colonel Gatewood,” brother John recalled. It was located with Warm Spring Mountain to the east and the Allegheny Mountains to the west. “The little valley stretched up Big Back Creek perhaps eight or ten miles and ranged from two hundred and fifty feet to half a mile in width. In that section at that time, the mountains abounded with game, bear, deer, wolves, wild cats, panthers, catamount, 
wild turkey, pheasants, and in fact all manner of game, and our chief occupation while in that section was hunting, trapping, and fishing,” John wrote. 

In 1873 or ’74, the family moved to Greenbrier County, crossing the Allegheny Mountains in ox carts. They lived for about a year on Captain William Reed’s farm, about a mile and a half northwest of Frankfort. They then lived for three years on the Lewis Creigh farm, then moved to Monroe County, to a section known as Swopes Knobs in the mountains near Johnson’s Crossroads, about 15 miles from Union. Later the family moved to Henry County, Ky.

During the years that James lived in Greenbrier and Monroe counties, he worked most of the time as a “professional hacker of brush” on the mountains near Cranberry Glades in Pocahontas County, according to his brother.

“While so engaged he came in contact with a Professor of Music from Richmond, Va., L.J. Whitt, who was also a Professor of Penmanship,” John continued, “and the two became very much interested in each other, and Professor Whitt induced Mr. Harlan to travel with him and give music lessons and also take lessons in penmanship from him. They traveled together for two years or more, making quite a success in their profession. After Professor Whitt had returned to Richmond from West Virginia, Mr. Harlan took up his profession of teaching penmanship as well as giving music lessons on banjo and violin, more especially on the banjo.” James became well known by traveling around to the crossroads school houses and teaching music and penmanship. 

James Harlan’s first banjo was a large gourd strung with horse hair, made for him by his grandfather’s servant, known as Uncle Lewis, who drove the family carriage.

“After young Harlan got so he could strike a few tunes, there was a young lady in the neighborhood, Miss Mollie Clark, who took an interest in him, and being a good performer on the banjo herself, she taught him all the fundamental principles that she knew concerning banjo picking,” John wrote.

He was considered a “very great entertainer,” according to his brother, who added, “Young Harlan was always ready to play for the old fashion dances or help entertain the youngsters in the several communities in which he lived, but never charged anything for this service. It was always rendered cheerfully. However, he made a nominal charge for lessons in penmanship and music.”

The family moved to Henry County, Ky, near New Castle, in 1881. In Kentucky, James Harlan continued to teach music and penmanship for a number of years, teaching in Indiana, Ohio, Arkansas, and Tennessee as well. 

Around 1915, he began to work for the railroad in Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky. In 1927, the year John Harlan wrote his sketch, his brother was located in Covington, Ky., and had been working for the Louisville and Nashville Railroad Company for three years. He was planning to travel back to Virginia to participate in the Old Fiddler’s Contest at Ronceverte.

I found this poem a while ago and think it is very appropriate for those who are “hooked” on researching their family heritage. It certainly fits many Harlan descendants who have pursued their family lineage.

Keep climbing those trees!

ANCESTORS

The dusty libraries we’ve delved,
Over massive tomes we’ve poured.
And lore about our ancestors
Have gleamed as our reward.

We’ve found their names ’mid emigrants
Who left Old England’s shore
On “Mayflower”, “Ann” and “Hercules”
And other ships galore.

The search for hidden ancestors
Is an alluring quest
Which never gives its devotees
A single moment’s rest.

To all whose minds are in a groove,
Or prone to slothful ease,
We recommend the exercise
Of climbing family trees.

by Minerva Isabel Freeman
August 7, 1925
