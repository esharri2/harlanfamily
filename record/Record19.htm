              by Jane Harlan 

            <p>Warren County, Ohio, is a treasure of Harlan family history, especially 

              for the descendants of George (#180) and George (#672). There are 

              numerous other Harlans who once lived there, and many are buried 

              there. </p>

            <p>The White Brick Meeting House in Waynesville, Ohio, pictured, was 

              attended by numerous Harlans. It was built in 1811.</p>

      <p>The Miami Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends opened 

        on October 13, 1803. It still holds regular services on Sundays. The modern 

        Quakers have remodeled the building so that it has running water and electricity. 

        Worship is traditional. When I attended, everyone sat in silence for 45 

        minutes. 

      <p>Inside the meeting house is a sign on the wall telling how the Quakers 

        moved to the area for the express purpose of protesting slavery. It reads, 

        "There is no parallel in human history to the migration of Quakers from 

        the South to the Northwest Territory in that it was done as a moral protest 

        against the treatment of another race rather than of those migrating." 

      <p>Across the street from the meeting house is the cemetery where many Harlans 

        are buried. There are only a few markers on the early graves in the cemetery. 

        Families were not buried together. They were buried in the order in which 

        they died. To find where a grave might be located, you have to find markers 

        from the period and estimate about where your ancestor is buried. There 

        were no flowers placed on the graves during my visits. </p>

      <p>According to Alpheus Harlan's book, George Harlan (#180) and his family 

        migrated to Warren County, Ohio, in 1805 or possibly earlier. Aaron Harlan 

        (#671), the son of George (#180), is described as arriving in Warren County 

        in 1796. Another son, George (#672) arrived in 1797. George's (#672) and 

        Aaron's (#671) siblings, Sarah Harlan (#674), Samuel Harlan (#675), Moses 

        Harlan (#676) and Silas Harlan (#677) all lived in Warren County at some 

        point. </p>

      <p>Waynesville, Ohio, promotes its history with a brochure telling of its 

        role in the Underground Railroad. The Little Miami River in the area was 

        a thoroughfare for fugitive slaves moving north from the Ohio River. Tunnels 

        connected the Little Miami River with homes in Waynesville. There were 

        numerous hideaways and caves where slaves were concealed before moving 

        onward. Portions of the tunnels are still in existence today. One home 

        even had a tower used to spot approaching slaves and their pursuers. Modern 

        Waynesville is a town that profits from and promotes its history with 

        numerous craft and antique shops. </p>

      <p>George Harlan (#672) was the first Sheriff elected in Warren County in 

        1803. (One can speculate as to why a Quaker would have been elected Sheriff 

        in a community committed to illegal activities spearheaded by the Quakers!) 

        George (#672) eventually held a number of public offices, served as Associate 

        Judge from 1810-1816 and as a member of the General Assembly from 1807-1808. 

      </p>

      <p>George Harlan (#672) and his wife, Esther, raised ten children starting 

        out in a log cabin in 1797. The log cabin was eventually replaced by a 

        large brick home that still stands and is occupied. It is located on Harlan 

        Road just north of Ridgeville and four miles west of Waynesville. The 

        current owners were thrilled to hear more about the people who built their 

        home and to learn that it is much older than they thought. (Jane visited 

        with them on July 7, 2001.) There are very old trees around the house 

        that may have been planted by the original residents. Inside the house 

        are a number of features that most likely date back to the Harlans. </p>

      <p>Alpheus Harlan, in his book, tells of numerous Harlans who were born 

        in this house. He describes the descendants of Moses Harlan (#2260) as 

        occupying this house when his genealogy book was published in 1914. The 

        current owners are not aware of any personal relationship to the Harlans. 

      </p>

      <p>One of the remarkable accomplishments of George (#180) and George (#672) 

        was their ability to produce public-spirited descendants committed to 

        the law and a fair legal system. George's (#672) son, Aaron Harlan (#2256), 

        also held public offices including service in the U.S. Congress. Harlan 

        Township, within Warren County, is named after him. U.S. Senator James 

        Harlan (#2297) is a descendant of George (#180). James' father, Silas 

        Harlan (#677), migrated to Warren County with his grandparents, George 

        (#180) and Margery Harlan, and he was adopted and raised by them. The 

        daughter of Senator James Harlan (#2297), Mary Harlan (#5864), married 

        Robert Todd Lincoln. </p>

      <p>George Harlan (#672) was the father of seven sons. Six of the seven became 

        lawyers, judges, or in the case of Jacob (#2254), the Clerk of Court. 

        A review of their history in Alpheus Harlan's book shows a remarkable 

        interest in law and public affairs for one family. Justin Harlan (#2255) 

        was a member of the convention that framed the Illinois Constitution of 

        1847. He served as a Circuit Judge in Clark County, Illinois, from 1848-1861. 

        Aaron Harlan (#2256) served in both the Ohio General Assembly and the 

        Ohio State Senate. He was a member of the Constitutional Convention of 

        Ohio in 1850 and 1851, and he later served in Congress. Robert Barclay 

        Harlan (#2259) served in the Ohio House and as a Judge of the Court of 

        Common Pleas in Clinton County. Newton Harlan (#2261), a lawyer from Washington 

        D.C., died in Warren County while visiting his brother, Moses. Howard 

        Harlan (#2262) was another lawyer practicing in Washington D.C. </p>

      <p>In addition to having numerous specialty shops, antique shops and historical 

        attractions, Waynesville, Ohio, also has a paved flat bike trail extending 

        a number of miles along the Little Miami River. </p>

      <p>Warren County, Ohio, has a number of resources for those who want to 

        know more about their ancestors in that county. The Mary Cook Public Library 

        is located at 381 Old Stage Rd., Waynesville, Ohio 45068. Lebanon, the 

        county seat of Warren County, has the Warren County Historical Society 

        Museum at 103 S. Broadway, Lebanon, Ohio 45036, and the Warren County 

        Genealogical Society at 190 New St., P.O. Box 296, Lebanon, Ohio 45036. 

      <p><i>Submitted by Attorney Jane Harlan, Somerset, Kentucky, descendant 

        of George (#672), Jacob (#2254), Martin (#5736), Eugene (born 1860, Peoria 

        Co., Ill.,), and Ellis (born 1908, Guthrie Co., Iowa) Her father, Ellis 

        Harlan, played the mouthharp at the 1997 reunion. She played the flute.

<p><b><a name="story tellers"></a>THE FAMILY STORY TELLERS </b></p>

<p> My feelings are that in each family there is one who seems called to find 

  the ancestors. To put flesh on their bones and make them live again, to tell 

  the family story and to feel that some-how they know and approve. To me, doing 

  genealogy is not a cold gathering of facts but, instead, breathing life into 

  all who have gone before. </p>

<p>We are the story tellers of the tribe. All tribes have one. We have been called 

  as it were by our genes. Those who have gone before cry out to us: tell our 

  story. So, we do. In finding them, we somehow find ourselves. How many graves 

  have I stood before now and cried? I have lost count. How many times have I 

  told the ancestors you have a wonderful family and you would be proud of us? 

  How many times have I walked up to a grave and felt somehow there was love there 

  for me? I cannot say. It goes beyond just documenting facts. It goes to who 

  am I and why do I do the things I do. It goes to seeing a cemetery about to 

  be lost forever to weeds and indifference and saying I can't let this happen. 

  The bones here are bones of my bone and flesh of my flesh. </p>

<p>It goes to doing something about it. It goes to pride in what our ancestors 

  were able to accomplish. How they contributed to what we are today. It goes 

  to respecting their hardships and losses, their never giving in or giving up, 

  their resoluteness to go on and build a life for their family.</p>

<p> It goes to deep pride that they fought to make and keep us a Nation. It goes 

  to a deep and immense understanding that they were doing it for us. That we 

  might be born who we are. That we might remember them. So we do. With love and 

  caring and scribing each fact of their existence, because we are them and they 

  are us. </p>

<p>So, as a scribe called, I tell the story of my family. It is up to that one 

  called in the next generation to answer the call and take his or her place in 

  the long line of family storytellers. That is why I do my family genealogy, 

  and that is what calls those young and old to step up and put flesh on the bones.

<p>According to a story in The Sedalia (MO) Democrat by Ron Jennings, a friend 

  of Alamander Jeremiah Harlan was to display a sign on A.J.'s lawn August 17, 

  urging motorists to "Honk for A.J.'s 100th Birthday." The friend observed A.J.'s 

  90th birthday the same way, and A.J. sat on his porch, acknowledging each toot 

  of the horn with a wave and a smile. 

<p>A.J. is listed in Alpheus Harlan's History and Genealogy of the Harlan Family, 

  page 952-a rare distinction these days. He and his two sons attended the 1987 

  Harlan Celebration 300 in Delaware. 

<p>Before retiring, A.J. was in the poultry business and later became a consultant 

  with large milling companies, retiring from Quaker Oats in 1961. 

<p>He exercises regularly, both physically and mentally, and is a 92-year member 

  of the nearby Wesley United Methodist Church where he has held many lay positions.

<p>Kate "Tolly" Roby, owner of one of the original Harlan houses in Chester County, 

  Pa., has heard from Mason-Dixon expert Ed Danson (The Harlan Record cover story, 

  Spring 2001) that National Geographic Television is interested in producing 

  a series of reports about the MasonDixon line for their weekly news program 

  "National Geographic Today." </p>

<p>They would like to visit the Stargazer's Stone this fall and see the Harlan 

  house, possibly to film the house and include views of the inside where Charles 

  Mason and Jeremiah Dixon spent so much of their time. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Roby says she is still researching the "1732 deaths" mystery (see 

  The Harlan Record, Spring 2000). She contacted a Temple University historian 

  who has expertise in early mortality statistics in Philadelphia. She didn't 

  have any answers, but said it was an intriguing puzzle, similar to another episode 

  she's aware of that happened nearby, about 30 years earlier. In that instance, 

  eight men died, leaving seven widows and a gang of children behind. <br>

<p>The McMurray family who owns Spring Hill in Eastern West Virginia, the original 

  homestead of George #45, announce the death of Margaretta Douglass ("Dougie") 

  Harlan on March 28, 2001. She was 89 years old and was the last of this branch 

  of the family with the Harlan surname. "Harlan Homecoming," a reunion of Harlan 

  relatives in 1998, was in her honor. 

<p>In addition, her first cousin Ida Lefevre Snyder, daughter of Amelia Keerl 

  Harlan Lefevre, died in September, 2000, at the age of 84. Both of the women 

  were the granddaughters of George Boyd Harlan, the great-grandson of George#45.

        of his history as I ought to. He was a large man, six feet two inches 

        and stout. He and his brother Joshua, who was a pioneer of Connersville, 

        Fayette County, Indianna: [sic] were said to be the two handsomest men 

        between the two Miami Rivers, Mother used to tell us. He was very fair 

        and had blue eyes. He had a heavy beard but always shaved. When I knew 

        him his hair was white. He was fat and fair and quite lame from inflammatory 

        rheumatism. He had been a great athlete in his prime and in wrestling 

        with an Indian "downed" him three times, he used to relate. Grandfather 

        had a strong intellect and was very intelligent and had a library, that 

        for the time was very extensive. He was a great talker and fond of telling 

        anecdotes and "yarns" and was a great laugher and cheerful and cordial

      <p>An old man traveling a lone highway <br>

        Came at the evening cold and gray, <br>

        To a chasm vast and deep and wide, <br>

        Through which was flowing a sullen tide. 

      <p>The old man crossed in the twilight dim, <br>

        The sullen stream held no fears for him; <br>

        But he turned when safe on the other side, <br>

        And builded a bridge to span the tide. 

      <p>"Old man," cried a fellow pilgrim near, <br>

        "You're wasting your time in building here, <br>

        Your journey will end with the closing day; <br>

        You never again will pass this way, <br>

        You have crossed the chasm deep and wide, <br>

        Why build you this bridge at even-tide?" 

      <p>The builder lifted his old gray head: <br>

        "Good friend, in the path I have come," he said, <br>

        "There followeth after me today <br>

        A youth whose feet must pass this way.<br>

        This stream which has been as naught to me, <br>

        To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be; <br>

        He, too, must cross in the twilight dim--- <br>

    <td width="50%" valign="top" height="671"> 

      <p>Life on the Kansas Prairie in the 1870s was not only recalled but recorded 

        by Virginia Jones-Harlan Barr in 1940 as a gift for her grandchildren. 

        Her grand-parents-Sarah and John Carter Harlan #1724 -and their children 

        moved to Smith County, Kansas, in 1871 and homesteaded 480 acres. Later 

        John became a probate judge. Virginia's mother died when she was born 

        in 1866, and she was adopted by her Harlan grandparents. 

      <p>The family first built a barn and lived in it while building their house. 

        Times were often difficult, and homesteaders were lonely. In that part 

        of the country, the judge's house was the largest and the only one with 

        board floors, so it was often the scene of entertainment. Virgie's uncles 

        were the only musicians for miles around but were soon joined by Dan Kelley, 

        a man from Rhode Island who knew all the latest songs. 

      <p> Dan courted (and later married) Virgie's Aunt Lulu, and at parties they 

        enjoyed dancing while Uncles Eugene and Clarence played the violin and 

        guitar. The men soon formed the Harlan Brothers Orchestra. 

      <p>In the early pioneer days of Smith County, Kansas, a poem was written 

        by Dr. Brewster M. Higley, called "Oh Give Me a Home". He showed the words 

        to Dan Kelley who, before coming to Kansas, had been a bugler in the Union 

        Army during the Civil War and had the ability to compose music. 

      <p>The next evening when Dan went to the Harlan home to see Lulu, he tried 

        the song out before the family. The judge thought it should have some 

        sort of a refrain, and the group came up with a version, later revised. 

      <p>Sarah Harlan liked the tune, and Virgie, age 9, caught up the song quickly 

        and sang with the men as they played the new melody and sang the song. 

        Little Virgie suggested they have a dance and surprise everyone with the 

        song. 

      <p>The dance was held on a Friday night in April, 1873, and young people 

        from miles around came for the event. <a href="#cont">(cont)</a> 

    </td>

    <td width="49%" valign="top" height="671"> 

      <p><a name="cont"></a>Refreshments were served at 11:00 p.m. Then Dan began 

        to play the music he composed on his violin, and he and Virgie sang the 

        words to Dr. Higley's poem.</p>

      <p>Years later, a lawsuit was filed by a couple in Arizona who claimed that 

        they had written the words and music to a song they called "My Arizona 

        Home" and had copyrighted it in 1905. As a result, the song was taken 

        off the airways, publishing ceased and professional singers could no longer 

        perform it. </p>

      <p>After years of investigating, an attorney hired by the music interests 

        presented evidence that the words were written by Dr. Higley and that 

        Dan Kelley supplied the music, and the Arizona couple lost their lawsuit. 

        In 1947, the Kansas House of Representatives introduced a bill to make 

        it the official state song which was adopted on June 30 of that year. 

      </p>

      <p>Some of the original words to "The Western Home," which had six verses, 

        are: </p>

      <blockquote>

        <p>Oh, give me a home <br>

          Where the buffalo roam <br>

          Where the deer and the antelope play; <br>

          Where seldom is heard <br>

          A discouraging word, <br>

          And the sky is not cloudy all day. </p>

        <p>Chorus: <br>

          A home, a home <br>

          Where the deer and the antelope play; <br>

          Where never is heard <br>

          A discouraging word, <br>

          And the sky is not cloudy all day. </p>

        <p>Oh, give me the land <br>

          Where the bright diamond sand <br>

          Throws its light on the glittering stream<br>

          Where glideth along <br>

          The graceful white swan <br>

          Like a maid in her heavenly dream. </p>

<p><b><a name="wife of justice"></a>Work by Wife of Justice John Marshall Harlan 

  Is Published</b> 

<p>Word comes from Joseph B. Harlan, Esq., a member of the Supreme Court Historical 

  Society, that a story by Malvina Shanklin Harlan was recently published in the 

  Society's Journal.. 

<p><i>Some Memories of a Long Life 1854-1911</i>, authored by Malvina Shanklin 

  Harlan in 1915, wife of Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan, encompasses 

  her entire life with John Marshall Harlan from her marriage at age 17 (1826) 

  until his demise (1911). The book is the result of the work of Associate Justice 

  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, her law clerks and the "fine mind and hand of historian 

  Linda Przybyszewski, author of <i>The Republic According to John Marshall Harlan</i>." 

<p>Joseph Harlan believes the Harlan family will find this work of great interest 

  from several perspectives. "The life she called long is filled with anecdotes 

  and insights about politics and religion in that era, the Supreme Court years 

  1877 to 1911 and the Harlan family. The reader is exposed to the Hayes White 

  House through Malvina's friendship with First Lady Lucy Hayes, nicknamed 'Lemonade 

  Lucy' for her avid temperance. 

<p>"We learn of Malvina's extraordinary encouragement when her husband wrote the 

  lone dissent from the Supreme Court's judgment striking down the Civil Rights 

  Act of 1875, a measure Congress enacted to promote equal treatment, without 

  regard to race, in various public accommodations." 

<p><i>Note: At this time, extra copies of the Journal are not available. If reprints 

  become available at a later date, the information will be posted on The Message 

  Center of the Harlan Web site.</i><br>

<p><b><a name="Harlan Lincoln"></a>Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation</b> <br>

  By Lynn Ellsworth </p>

<p>In the small Midwestern town of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, on the campus of Iowa Wesleyan 

  College, stands the home of James Harlan. James Harlan was an early president 

  of the college, a U.S. Senator, Secretary of the Department of the Interior 

  and friend of Abraham Lincoln. 

<p>James Harlan's daughter, Mary, married Robert Todd Lincoln, son of the President. 

  They brought their three children to this home during summers in the late 1870s 

  and the 1880s. In 1895, the Robert Todd Lincolns became owners and made significant 

  improvements to the home, and in 1907, Mary Harlan Lincoln gave the house to 

  Iowa Wesleyan College "as a tribute to the memory of my father." The house has 

  been used as a home for Iowa Wesleyan presidents and faculty, Pi Beta Phi chapter 

  rooms, the art house, and since 1959, as a museum. 

<p>The museum collection includes Harlan-Lincoln artifacts. Mary Todd Lincoln's 

  mourning veil and a fragment of the coat Abraham Lincoln was wearing when he 

  was assassinated are part of the collection. Currently, the co at fragment is 

  on exhibit at the Lincoln Museum in Ft. Wayne, Indiana. James Harlan's wooden 

  recliner, desk, and game table are some of the original pieces in the house. 

  A door measuring the heights of his three grandchildren, Mary, Abraham II (Jack), 

  and Jessie in 1883 is on exhibit, as well as other family items. 

<p>College personnel and community volunteers are working to renovate the Harlan-Lincoln 

  House, which is listed on the National Historic Register. In 1997, during their 

  reunion in Mt. Pleasant, the Harlan Family gave $2,500 toward an architect's 

  study for renovating the house. The architect's reuse plan calls for building 

  a one-story addition onto the back of the house, including a warming kitchen 

  and restrooms for receptions. The plan also includes adding a wrap-around porch 

  similar to one there in 1895 and a patio and garden west of the House. 

<p>Because the existing 1876 structure is only a portion remaining of the original 

  Harlan residence, it does not convey the complete story of the day-to-day life 

  of the Harlans and Lincolns. However it can serve as the setting to tell the 

  story of this family and their place in local and national history. 

<p>Just as Mary Harlan Lincoln hosted parties here, the house should again welcome 

  friends and guests of Iowa Wesleyan. A dining-reception area, in addition to 

  the museum, will continue to illustrate the story of the family's historical 

  significance. A community relations office, located on the second floor, will 

  bring activity to the house, reflecting graciousness, vitality, and a sense 

  of tradition. 

<p>The Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation Committee and Iowa Wesleyan College continue 

  to work to revitalize the historic home of James Harlan. In June, the State 

  Historical Society of Iowa notified the Committee of its successful grant application 

  for matching funds to reinforce the main floor and do plumbing and electrical 

  updates under the HRDP (Historic Resource Development Program). There were 122 

  applications, with only 44 recipients. This endorsement by the State Historical 

  Society of Iowa lends a significant boost to the work of the Committee. 

<p>The Committee has also received financial support from various individuals 

  and two local foundations. Lynn Ellsworth, archivist for Iowa Wesleyan and Executive 

  Director of the Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation Committee, has given programs 

  about the house and its famous inhabitants for many local organizations, and 

  the Committee has held open houses, as well as a celebration for James Harlan's 

  180th birthday! Recently, information about the Harlan-Lincoln House was added 

  to the Web site: <a href="http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org">http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org</a> 

  Progress is steady, but the ultimate goal of a renovated building with a professionally 

  cared-for museum and a hospitality center is still in the future.

  contact Lynn Ellsworth at 1-800-582-2383, or e-mail: <a href="mailto:iwcarch@iwc.edu">iwcarch@iwc.edu</a>

<p>"You have a lot to be thankful for," said Aunt Kathy. 

<p>"Yeah, I know," I replied. I thought she was referring to the fact that four 

  generations from across the United States were celebrating Mom and Dad's 50th 

  wedding anniversary on December 28, 2000. 

<p>What Aunt Kathy was referring to was the fact that both my mom and dad- Jim 

  and Sue Harlan of Phoenix-had been able to celebrate the 50th anniversary of 

  Sue's parents, Tom and Helen McCann of New Castle, PA, in 1983; and the 70th 

  anniversary of Jim's parents, David and Fanny Harlan, also of New Castle, earlier 

  in 2000. 

<p>Jim and Sue renewed their vows before their siblings, five children and their 

  families, as well as their church family and Harlan Family friends. Jim and 

  Sue own Harlan's Stitchery by Sue. <br>

<p><b><a name="HFA support"></a>The Harlan Family in America Needs Your Support</b>

<p>It has been a proud tradition of The Harlan Family that no dues are required 

  for membership. The association wants all Harlan descendants to have access 

  to knowledge of the family's heritage. So far, costs of maintaining the organization 

  have been met by contributions from interested Harlans, plus modest profits 

  from the sale of reprints of Alpheus Harlan's The History and Genealogy of the 

  Harlan Family. 

<p>We're gearing up for the 2002 Harlan Reunion in Pennsylvania, and there will 

  be substantial upfront costs for this national gathering of Harlan kinfolk. 

  The Harlan Family in America needs your contributions to help with these expenses, 

  as well as covering the costs of printing and mailing our newsletter, The Harlan 

  Record. 

<p>Officers and board members pay their own expenses to attend board meetings, 

  so any donations you make go directly to expenses incurred for the Reunion plus 

  maintaining the organization, printing and postage. Please consider contributing 

  to the Harlan cause. 

<p>The Harlan Family in America is very appreciative of those who have supported 

  it in the past. The goal of building and maintaining the organization of one 

  of America's leading families again needs your help. Thanks!

<p><b><a name="quaker"></a>Our Quaker Heritage </b>

<p>A question was posed to editors of <i>The Old Farmer's Almanac</i>: <b>"Why 

  are members of the Society of Friends called Quakers?"</b> 

<p>The answer: The Society of Friends had its origins in England, where a preacher 

  named George Fox (guided by what he called "Inner Light" and committed to a 

  "priesthood of believers") began to put together the basic tenets of the religion 

  about 1647. In 1650, Fox wrote in his journal: "Justice Gervase Bennett first 

  called us Quakers because we bid him tremble at the word of God."

<p>Originally, worship was conducted largely in meditative silence unless a member 

  was moved, spiritually, to speak. Years later, hymns and readings were added. 

<p>Some Quakers appeared in the American colonies beginning in the 1650s, only 

  a few years after the Society had been founded in England. Those who settled 

  in New England often experienced cruel persecution, and they later moved to 

  more tolerant colonies. Large scale migration of Friends began in 1675 when 

  the first full shipload of Quakers disembarked in West Jersey. The migration 

  of Friends increased to 23 ships in 1682, sailing into Delaware Bay with more 

  than 2,000 immigrants who founded the colony of Pennsylvania. 

<p>A year before, in 1681, William Penn, an Englishman and Friend, received a 

  tract of land in America from King Charles II-payment of a debt owed Penn's 

  father-that became the "holy experiment" of a Society of Friends colony in Pennsylvania. 

  Charles II gave it its name and established it as a place where religious and 

  political freedom could flourish. 

<p>A few years later-1687-George and Michael Harlan arrived in New Castle, Delaware, 

  and became a part of the Quaker community in America. 

<p>Some basic principles of the Society included a renunciation of war and violence 

  of many kinds, the abolition of slavery, prison reform, temperance and improved 

  education-virtually all still in effect today. 

<p>The early Friends in England split off from the episcopal Church of England, 

  preferring a more direct relationship between believers and God. It is estimated 

  that today there are about 200,000 Quakers worldwide.
