    and Lonely Dissent by C. J. King </b><br>
    </i></p>
    <p align="left"><i>Editor's Note: This year marks the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme
    Court decision Brown v. Board of Education, which ended state-sanctioned school
    segregation. I recently asked a group of school kids, and found that they universally know
    the name and courage of Rosa Parks. How many Harlans also know about the brave acts of
    Homer Plessy and of Justice John Marshall Harlan, the lone dissenter to the Supreme
    Court&#146;s </i>Plessy v. Ferguson<i> &#147;separate but equal&#148; decision? C.J.K</i>.
    </p>
    <p align="left">In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation,
    freeing all slaves in the Confederate states. When the proclamation took effect on Jan. 1,
    1863, Colonel John Marshall Harlan, an officer with the Kentucky infantry, denounced it as
    &#147;unconstitutional and null and void.&#148; He had joined Lincoln&#146;s army to help
    preserve the Union, not to abolish slavery. </p>
    <p align="left">A slaveholder himself, Harlan was quite vocal in his defense of slavery as
    an issue of personal property rights the government should not intrude upon. In fact, he
    had threatened to resign his commission over the proclamation, but it was the death of his
    father a few months later that caused him to leave the Union army, return to Frankfort,
    Ky., and take over his father&#146;s law practice. He continued to own a few household
    slaves until the Thirteenth Amendment abolished the institution throughout the United
    States. Then he reluctantly complied, freeing them, but denouncing the amendment as a
    &#147;flagrant invasion of the right of self-government.&#148; </td>

<p align="center">How did this vigorous supporter of slavery come to be the lone voice of
dissent in the famous <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> case, which legalized segregation? </p>

<p align="center">By 1871, Harlan had changed his mind, saying, &#147;I have lived long
enough to feel and declare that the most perfect despotism that ever existed on this earth
was the institution of African slavery. I rejoice that it is gone.&#148; </p>

<p align="center">Some attribute this change of attitude to simple political expediency.
After being affiliated with several political parties, he had settled into the Republican
party, which opposed slavery. But beyond that was the influence of his father, who, though
a slave owner, hated the brutality of the system. His father&#146;s close friend, Henry
Clay, opposed slavery and favored gradual emancipation, as did many of Harlan&#146;s
teachers in college and law school and Harlan&#146;s wife. </p>

<p align="center">The legal struggle over blacks&#146; rights continued after the Civil
War, as southern states passed laws restricting them. Congress passed the Fourteenth and
Fifteenth Amendments, the first guaranteeing equal protection to all citizens, the second
granting black males the right to vote. But white opposition continued, sometimes
violently. In this time of beatings, killings, arson, and other acts of terrorism, those
who favored segregation began to gain control, enacting what became known as Jim Crow
laws. </p>

<p align="center">In 1890, Louisiana passed the Separate Car Act, mandating &#147;separate
but equal&#148; accommo-dations for blacks and whites on all passenger railways operating
within the state. Whites were not allowed in cars assigned for blacks, nor vice versa,
except for black nurses attending white children. Those who did not obey faced a $25 fine
or a 20-day jail term. </p>

<p align="center">Immediately, a group of prominent black residents in New Orleans
organized to fight the law&#146;s constitutionality. A 30-year-old shoemaker named Homer
Plessy agreed to be the guinea pig challenging the law. On June 7, 1892, Plessy bought a
ticket from New Orleans to Covington, La. He boarded the train and took a seat in the
whites-only car. Plessy didn&#146;t look out of place because he was light-skinned (he was
only one-eighth black), but the conductor discovered Plessy&#146;s &#147;colored&#148;
status and had him arrested when he refused to move.</p>

<p align="center">Before the case could be heard in district court, Plessy&#146;s lawyers
filed papers with the Louisiana Supreme Court, arguing that district court judge Justice
John Howard Ferguson had no authority over the case because of the constitutionality
question. In 1893, the Louisiana Supreme Court disagreed, ruling the law was
constitutional, and giving Plessy&#146;s lawyers what they had hoped for, the right to
take the case before the U.S. Supreme Court. </p>

<p align="center">It was three years before the Court heard the case. Plessy&#146;s
lawyers did not have an easy task, because more precedents existed countering their claims
than supporting them, and because most of the justices were not inclined to favor their
arguments. The lawyers were hopeful, but they felt they really could count on only one
vote. It turned out they were right. When the Court handed down its decision, only one
justice went on record as a dissenter: Justice John Marshall Harlan. </p>

<p align="center">The majority opinion, written by Justice Henry Billings Brown, argued
that while blacks and whites were politically equal, they were not socially equal, and the
Fourteenth Amendment surely could not have intended to enforce &#147;commingling of the
two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.&#148; </p>

<p align="center">Plessy&#146;s lawyers had argued that even though the Separate Car Act
pretended to guarantee equal accommodations, the actual practice was something else.</p>

<p align="center">Justice Harlan agreed and argued that the Louisiana law&#146;s intent
was to satisfy white racial prejudice. &#147;What can more certainly arouse race hate,
more certainly create and perpetuate a feeling of distrust between these races, than state
enactments, which, in fact, proceed on the ground that they cannot be allowed to sit in
public coaches occupied by white citizens? That, as all will admit, is the real meaning of
such legislation.&#148; </p>

<p align="center">Justice Harlan believed that the Louisiana law was &#147;hostile to both
the spirit and the letter of the Constitution.&#148; He argued that if states were allowed
to segregate by race, what would prevent them from also segregating by religion or other
distinctions? &#147;The thin disguise of &#145;equal&#146; accommo-dations for passengers
in railroad coaches will not mislead any one, nor atone for the wrong this day done,&#148;
he argued. </p>

<p align="center">The majority opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson gave support to even more Jim
Crow laws during the years following. Soon &#147;separate but equal&#148; applied to
schools, restaurants, restrooms, community swimming pools, and water coolers. And as time
went on, no one even pretended the accommodations were equal. The resulting caste system
relegated African Americans to inferior status that lasted from birth to death. </p>

<p align="center">During the 1940s and &#146;50s, Thurgood Marshall, who was then the lead
attorney for the NAACP, would shore himself up during low moments in the fight to end
segregation by reading from Harlan&#146;s dissent. According to one of Marshall&#146;s
colleagues, Judge Constance Baker Motley, &#147;Marshall admired the courage of Harlan
more than any justice who has ever sat on the Supreme Court.&#148; Marshall&#146;s
favorite line was, &#147;Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates
classes among citizens.&#148; </p>

<p align="center">It took 58 years before Justice Harlan&#146;s minority opinion become
the majority one, when the Supreme Court overturned the &#147;separate but equal&#148;
principle in 1954 with Brown v. Board of Education. Justice Earl Warren, who wrote that
opinion, stated that &#147;in the field of public education, the doctrine of
&#145;separate but equal&#146; has no place. Separate educational facilities are
inherently unequal.&#148; </p>

<p align="center">Anyone alive for the past 50 years knows that the struggle for equality
did not end even then. But 2004 marks the 50-year anniversary of the Brown v. Board of
Education decision, which carries within it the legacy of Justice John Marshall
Harlan&#146;s dissent. </p>

<p>Looking ahead to a 2007 national Harlan Reunion in the West, the officers and board
members of The Harlan Family in America plan to meet April 17, 2004, in the Reno, Nev.,
area. </p>

<p>Nearby Sparks and Truckee, Calif., are locations familiar to both the ill-fated Donner
party and the Harlan family, led by George Harlan (#852) in 1846-47. </p>

<p align="center"><b><a name="ellis"></a>Who Was Ellis Lamar Harlan?<br>
Submitted by Clinton Cross </b></p>

<p align="center">In a recent deposition, Dr. Larry Gladstone (f/k/a Ladislav Gladdstein),
born September 26, 1922, in a little village in eastern Czechoslovakia, recalled his
experiences as a child in Czechoslovakia and as a prisoner of the Hungarians and the
Germans during World War II. </p>

<p align="center">Born in the same house where his great-grandfather was born in 1828,
Gladstone&#146;s childhood was relatively pleasant. His father was an innkeeper and a
teacher. Gladstone obtained a good high school education. As he grew older, however, he
began to suffer the consequences of anti-Semitism. Other children cursed him for being a
&#147;Christ-Killer&#148; and sometimes beat him up.</p>

<p align="center">In 1943, Gladstone was forced to enroll in a labor battalion. He
performed rigorous manual labor every day with minimal food rations. Many of his fellow
laborers died. He was shipped from one place to another, and finally to Hungary. He at one
point passed through a deserted village which had previously been inhabited by Jews. When
he asked what happened to the inhabitants, a German soldier matter-of-factly explained,
&#147;We shot them all.&#148;</p>

<p align="center">As the war drew to a close in 1944, Gladstone was liberated by an
American soldier. The soldier&#146;s name was Ellis Lamar Harlan. </p>

<p align="center">Gladstone had with him at the time a postcard picturing a river and a
bridge in a Czechoslovakian city. Harlan signed his name on the postcard, and Gladstone
never forgot Ellis Lamar Harlan. He treasured the postcard all his life.</p>

<p align="center">Gladstone immigrated to the United States and tried to find Harlan. In
his deposition, Gladstone, now eighty-one years old, recalled tearfully, &#147;I tried to
find this guy Harlan so many times, and I couldn&#146;t find him. It&#146;s his signature
right here.&#148; </p>

<p align="center">Ellis Lamar Harlan died in 1974. After his deposition, however, Dr.
Gladstone located Ellis&#146;s children. He learned that Ellis had taken many pictures
during his liberation of Jews. These pictures were given to the Smithsonian Museum in
Washington, D.C. It is possible that Dr. Gladstone is the subject of one of these
pictures. </p>

<p align="center">Was Ellis Lamar Harlan related to the famous Ellis Harlan (#121) who
married a full-blood Cherokee and who was the subject of the story in the Fall, 2003,
Harlan Record?</p>

<p align="center">No one knows. </p>

<p align="center"><b><a name="ship"></a>Ship Leaves Famous Yard <br>
Story from BBC News, Northern Ireland, March 22, 2003, courtesy of Fred Harlan </b></p>

<p align="center">The last ship to be built at Harland and Wolff has finally left Belfast.
The Anvil Point set sail from Queen&#146;s Island on Saturday, ending almost 150 years of
shipbuilding at the famous yard. </p>

<p align="center">The ship&#146;s departure had been delayed because of a problem with its
German made engines. The </p>

<p align="center">22,000 tonne vessel is the second of two roll-on roll-off ferries built
at the yard for English shipping consortium Andrew Weir Shipping Ltd, which is leasing the
ship to the Ministry of Defence. </p>

<p align="center">It was named by Wendy Parker, wife of consortium member Michael Parker,
in a champagne ceremony in Belfast earlier this year. </p>

<p align="center">The Harland and Wolff company remains in business and is still tendering
for ship repair and overhaul work. However, the yard which once employed more than 30,000
people now has a core manual workforce of only a few dozen. </p>

<p align="center">Harland and Wolff will now be focusing on ship repair, converting
vessels for new uses and civil engineering. The company has recently built two bridges
which have been erected in Dublin. The yard can dry-fit bridges before installation and is
seeking design work for aircraft carriers. </p>

<p align="center">The company is currently tendering for a contract with a Chinese yard.</p>

<p><b><a name="renovations"></a>Renovations at the Harlan-Lincoln House </b></p>

<p>The Harlan-Lincoln House, located in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa, was the residence of U.S.
Senator James Harlan who was closely allied with President Abraham Lincoln, both
personally and politically. </p>

<p>Harlan&#146;s daughter, Mary, married Robert Todd Lincoln, the only child of the
President to survive to adulthood. The Robert Todd Lincolns brought their three children
to spend summers here. Harlan deeded the property to the Lincolns in 1895, and the home
became their secondary residence. In 1907, Mary Harlan Lincoln gave the house to Iowa
Wesleyan College as a tribute to the memory of her father. </p>

<p>Since March, 2002, when pipes froze and burst, the Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation
Committee at Iowa Wesleyan College has accomplished much to preserve the house. Following
the advice of an architect furnished by the State Historical Society of Iowa, the college
dismantled a one-story addition that was putting stress on the main, two-story structure.
The college also regraded the property for better drainage; repaired ceiling, walls, and
floor; installed a new heating, air conditioning, ventilation and security system with a
central alarm; and painted the house its original yellow. </p>

<p>Design and funding plans are now underway to reconstruct the 800 square foot wraparound
porch that Mary Harlan Lincoln built in 1895. This will create a more gracious appearance
and allow handicap access to the museum. </p>

<p>The Harlan-Lincoln House and museum tells the story of the James Harlan family from
when James and Ann Eliza Harlan built their home in 1876 to when their great-grandchildren
visited there in the early 1900s. Over 70 volunteers have participated on projects this
past year. Volunteers did carpentry work, cleaned, painted, altered curtains, repaired
broken furniture, inventoried, and moved artifacts and books. Contractors and suppliers
discounted their prices. Retired Iowa City guidance counselor Paul Juhl, whose avocation
is photo historian, made and donated 20 copies of the video &#147;The Lincoln
Grandchildren in Mount Pleasant, Iowa.&#148; The videos are given to those who make a $100
donation to the Harlan-Lincoln House (only four copies remain). </p>

<p>Art restorer Robert Norman of Pittsburg, Iowa, and Calvert, Texas, donated his time to
restore one painting and clean another. Two Civil War themed events, the Love and Valor
dramatic productions and Love and Valor Forest Home Cemetery tours, successfully raised
funds and awareness for the Harlan-Lincoln House. </p>

<p>Tours can be arranged by contacting Lynn Ellsworth, archivist for Iowa Wesleyan College
and Executive Director of the Harlan-Lincoln House Renovation Committee at 319-385-6320 or

<p><b><a name="followup"></a>Follow-up on the John H. Harland Company Story<br>
By John H. Harland of Kelowna B C, Canada</b></p>

<p>The Harlan Record, No. 23, Fall 2003, features an article about the founder of the John
H. Harland Company of Atlanta. A significant number of Harlan relatives will use checks
printed by this firm. </p>

<p>A word about his origins and possible connection to the descendants of George and
Michael Harlan may be of interest.</p>

<p>John Herdman Harland was born in Bessbrook, County Armagh, Ireland, on January 22,
1885. In later days the village became all too well known to units of the British Army, at
the time of the &#147;Troubles.&#148; </p>

<p>During the years of the Cold War, battalions were rotated through Bessbrook, spending
three months there as part of their training. They left their wives and children in
Germany, arrived in full battle order, had little to do with the local population, and
engaged in aggressive patrolling of the nearby &#147;South Armagh Triangle.&#148; </p>

<p>However effective this was in honing their military skills, I am sure they developed
little affection for the area.</p>

<p>Fortunately things have settled down over there now, and I imagine that the Army is
long gone and the village returned to the rural tranquility that John H. Harland would
have been familiar with in his youth.</p>

<p>The article in The Harlan Record covers his career in America, but what, if any, was
his relationship to the American Harlans? George and Michael Harlan were born in England
but spent some years in or near Lurgan, County Armagh, prior to coming to the Quaker
Colonies in Pennsylvania and Delaware, about 1687. </p>

<p>Their elder brother, Thomas, remained in Lurgan until his death and is buried there. He
had four sons, and I think it quite likely that John H. Harland was a descendant of one of
these. His father (also John Harland) believed that the family had Quaker connections but
apparently was uncertain of their exact nature. In turn, John Harland, the
great-grandfather of John H. Harland was born in 1784 and is buried in South Armagh, but
we know nothing of his family origins.</p>

<p>There are still Quaker Harlands in Lurgan to this day who must be descendants of the
Thomas Harland who came from Durham. County Armagh is not vast in area, but I am guessing
that in the 17th-18th Centuries, travel between its north and south areas was not easy.
However, in 1720, a canal was built from Lurgan to Newry, to connect Lough Neagh with the
sea, and this might explain a move by the family from the northern to the southern part of
the County. We can only speculate about this.</p>

<p>In summary, I suspect that a Quaker ancestor of John H. Harland was
&#147;disowned&#148; by the Society of Friends, and this was something he would have been
reluctant to discuss with his children and family. Likewise, his Quaker parents and
siblings severed all ties with the cast out relative, who became an unperson, never again
to be spoken of. Casting out could occur for what we would today consider quite trivial
reasons, but I believe the commonest cause was marriage outside the Faith.</p>

<p>As is always the case in Ireland, any genealogical search is complicated by the
destruction of parish records during the Irish Civil War in 1922.</p>

<p>Helen was born in Humboldt, Kans., in 1903, but at various times in her life, she lived
in Tampico and Mexico City, Tokyo and Shanghai, as well as several of the United States.
She served as field advisor for the Girl Scouts in the Iola area for seven years. </p>

<p>A three-month stint as curator of the local Allen County Historical Society turned into
an eleven-year stay from 1977-1988. Helen used her talents to create inspired museum
exhibits and also learned the art of properly preserving, exhibiting and storing
historical artifacts. </p>

<p>In 2002, the Allen County Museum named its library the &#147;Helen H. Henderson
Research Library,&#148; honoring her for years of tireless service and support for the
historical society. </p>

<p>Helen lives at Fountain Villa, an assisted living facility in Iola. A reception in
honor of her 100th birthday was held there last December 28 and during the two-hour
gathering, nearly 80 people from 10 cities and five states stopped by to wish her well.
She also received a call from a friend in England who once sent her the cartoon shown

<br>
Puxico High School, Puxico, Mo., recently dedicated its gymnasium to the memory of the
late Arnold Ryan, former coach and Harlan descendant. The dedication ceremony, held in the
school&#146;s packed cafeteria in August, 2003, included tributes paid by former
ballplayers and students of Ryan, who began his career in Puxico in 1945. </p>

<p>Ryan&#146;s widow, Nola, was presented an autographed copy of Matt Chaney&#146;s book,
&#147;My Name is Mister Ryan.&#148; The book, published in 1994, was signed by members of
Ryan&#146;s baseball, basketball and volleyball teams, as well as former students of both
Arnold and Nola Ryan. </p>

<p>Fundraising efforts are underway for a sign deserving of Coach Ryan. Under his
direction, Puxico made several appearances at state basketball tournaments and won state
titles in 1951 and 1952. He was tragically killed in 1970 when he was struck by a baseball
to the back of his head while at a practice session. </p>

<p>Some quotes of Ryan&#146;s, given by former students at the dedication, include:
&#147;If you don&#146;t like to lose, do something about it.&#148; &#147;You will win
because you will have worked harder and practiced more than the other team.&#148;
&#147;You will live by the rules. You will not correct any other player. You will not
question a referee&#146;s call, and you will conduct yourself in a manner, on and off the
court, that will bring honor to those whom you represent.&#148; </p>

<p><b><a name="John"></a>John Bailey Harlan Was Shrewd Detective </b></p>

<p>In the late 1800s, John B. Harlan, #7956 (v) in Alpheus Harlan&#146;s genealogy book,
was deeply involved in investigating a mysterious train wreck. </p>

<p>According to some undated mimeographed copies submitted by Juanita Creighton of
Richmond, Va., her great-uncle John Bailey Harlan was Louisville and Nashville Railroad
Company&#146;s shrewdest detective. He &#147;assumed charge of the investigation of the
wreck of a freight train in the Decatur yards Wednesday night. </p>

<p>The attempt was directed toward the fast mail train and as it was the sixth attempt to
wreck mail trains of the Louisville and Nashville, the road&#146;s chief of detectives is
directing the work in this district.&#148; </p>

<p>John was head of this special service of the L &amp; N Railroad for many years and was
reputed to be one of the best detectives in the south. &#147;It is confidently believed
that he will unravel the mystery surrounding repeated attempts to wreck trains on the
Louisville and Nashville.&#148; </p>

<p>The story goes on to say, &#147;The continuous attempts to derail and wreck passenger
trains on the L &amp; N have created the most exciting days experienced in Louisville and
Nashville circles in many months. The result is that every engineer, conductor, flagman
and other employee is making it a personal matter to assist in apprehending the
guilty.&#148; </p>

<p>However, a conclusion to the mystery of the train wrecks wasn&#146;t given. Some
believed that one man or one gang of men were responsible, possibly due to being
discharged from their jobs. </p>

<p>John Bailey Harlan, born 5/14/1864, was originally from Albemarle County, Va. He wrote
&#147;Pleasant Recollections&#148; about his life in Virginia, as well as an article about
his brother, James Forbes Harlan. </p>

U.S. Army Infantry Colonel with a 32-year career from World War II to Vietnam. After
retiring from the military, he became an Episcopal priest and served in Annandale, Va.,

<a name="determining"></a>Determining Unknown Birthdates <br>
by Cynthia Rhoades, Director of Genealogy </b></p>

<p>There is a process called Formula or Rule 8870 that enables one to determine the date
of birth if only the age and date of death are known. Using this Formula 8870 is a
tremendous help to ascertain a birth date. In order to arrive at the birth date you only
have to use the formula to quickly get the date of birth rather than try to count
backward. </p>

<p>For instance, if a tombstone records that a person died on May 6, 1889, and was 71
years, 7 months and 9 days old, this is a quick way to establish the date of birth: </p>
<dd align="center"><br>
  YEAR/MONTH/DAY </dd>

<table width="34%" border="0" cellspacing="1" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td width="53%">Died 6 May 1889</td>
    <td align="right" width="47%">18890506</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="53%">Subtract age at death</td>
    <td align="right" width="47%">- 710709</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="53%">(71 yrs, 7 mo, 9days)</td>
    <td align="right" width="47%">________</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td height="20" width="53%"></td>
    <td height="20" align="right" width="47%">18179797</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="53%">Subtract the formula</td>
    <td align="right" width="47%">- 8870</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="53%"></td>
    <td align="right" width="47%">18170927</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p align="center">(Born 1817, Sept. 27) </p>

<p>If the age in months and the age in days are less than the month and day in the date of
death, you can just subtract directly. I can give you an example that I know is correct. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Date of death - 1879 September 25 <br>
  Age at death - 83 yrs., 1 mo, 5 days <br>
  Subtract 83 from 1879 = 1796 <br>
  Subtract 1 from 9 = 8 <br>
  Subtract 5 from 25 = 20<br>
  Result = 1796 August 20, the date of birth </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hope you find this works for you when you are trying to determine your
ancestor&#146;s date of birth. <br>
